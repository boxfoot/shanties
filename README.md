# Shanty Collection

Work in progress - gatsby-powered collection of shanties and sea songs in easy to work with Markdown format.

## Hacking

```sh
# To develop with hot reloading etc
npm start

# To test a build
npm run build
npm run serve
```

## To Do

- [ ] Add more shanties
- [ ] Make a nicer design
- [ ] Set up github actions to publish somewhere (GH pages for now?)
- [ ] Write about/welcome message, contribution guidelines
- [ ] Hook up links/interface for suggesting corrections or additional shanties
- [ ] Add tags (e.g. halyard shanty, capstan shanty, songs about Liza, homeward bound, lost at sea, etc.)
- [ ] convert this list to GH issues...
