Come all you bold seamen, wherever you're bound,  
And always let Nelson's proud memory go round;  

And pray that the wars, and the tumults might cease,  
For the greatest of gifts is a sweet, lasting, peace.  

May the Lord put an end to these cruel old wars,  
And bring peace and contentment to all our brave Tars!
