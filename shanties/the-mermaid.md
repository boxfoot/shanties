title: The Mermaid  
---  

'Twas a Friday morn when we set sail  
and we were not far from the land  
When our captain, (s)he spied, a mer-i-maid so fair  
with a comb and a spyglass in her hand  

**Oh the ocean waves do roll**  
**And the stormy winds do blow**  
**Aye, and we poor sailors are skipping at the top**  
**And the landlubbers lie down, below, below, below**  
**And the landlubbers lie down below**  

Well up spoke the captain of our gallant ship,  
and a fine spoken (wo)man was (s)he  
"This fishy mermaid has warned me of our doom.  
We shall sink to the bottom of the sea"  

Well up-spoke the mate of our gallant ship,  
and a dashing young (wo)man was she  
(S)he says "I have a wife, in Brooklyn by the sea,  
and to-night a widow she will be"  

Well up-spoke the bo'sun of our gallant ship  
and the spawn of the devil was-(s)he  
(S)he-says "Man the capstan round boys, haul on the lines.  
You'll work to the bottom of the sea"  

Well up-spoke the cook of our gallant ship,  
and a greasy old butcher was (s)he  
(S)he-says "I care much more for my pots and my pans  
than I do for the bottom of the sea"  

Well up-spoke the cabin boy of our gallant ship,  
and a wretched liddle cabin boy was (s)he  
(S)he says "I left my fam'ly when I ran-away to sea,  
and to-night will they all grieve for me"  

Well up-spoke the grog-master of our gallant ship,  
and an old dirty boozer was (s)he  
(S)he-says "Seal-me-in-a-cask for I'd much rather drown  
in me rum than sober in salt-sea"  

Well up spoke the chaplain of our gallant ship,  
and a pale wizened codger was (s)he  
(S)he-says "You've-had your chance now, it's too late to repent.  
Laughing at you-all from Heaven I will be"  

Well up spoke the booty-master of our gallant ship,  
and a damn sly capital-ist was (s)he  
(S)he-says "Your deaths shall never settle in my books.  
In the next life you're still in debt to me"  

Well up spoke a sailor of our gallant ship,  
and secretly a maiden was (s)he  
(S)he-says "The safety card says 'Women and children first,'  
so the lifeboat should belong to me!"

Well one time 'round spun our gallant ship,  
and two times 'round went she  
Then three times 'round spun our gallant ship  
and she sank to the bottom of the sea
