Don't mind the rain, nor the rolling sea  
The weary night never worries me  
But the hardest time in a sailor's day  
Is to watch the sun as it dies away  
**It's one more day on the Grey Funnel Line**  
  
The finest ship that sailed the sea  
Is still a prison for the likes of me  
But give me wings like Noah's dove  
I'd fly up harbour to the girl I loveâ€¦  
**It's one more day on the Grey Funnel Line**  
  
Every time I gaze behind the screws  
Makes me long for old Peter's shoes  
I'd walk on down that silver lane  
And take my love in my arms again  
**It's one more day on the Grey Funnel Line**  
  
O Lord, if dreams were only real  
I'd have my hands on that wooden wheel  
And with all my heart I'd turn her 'round  
And tell the boys that we're homeward bound  
**It's one more day on the Grey Funnel Line**  
  
I'll pass the time like some machine  
Until the blue water turns to green  
Then I'll dance on down that walk ashore  
And sail the Grey Funnel Line no more  
**It's one more day on the Grey Funnel Line**
