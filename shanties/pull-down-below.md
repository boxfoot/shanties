title: Pull Down Below  
---  
  
I went to church and I went to chapel  
**Pull down below!**  
I went to church and I went to chapel  
**Pull down below!**  

**Oh, Hieland Laddie**  
**Pull down below!**  
**Hieland laddie, bonny laddie**  
**Pull down below!**  

Out on the road I found a saddle  
I found a saddle and an empty poke  

I found a saddle and an empty poke  
But where the hell is the bleedin' moke  

The moke is gone and I'll go too  
I'll sail away to Backaloo  

Oh, hoist 'er up and away we'll go  
Hoist 'er up from down below  

Oh, giver 'er sheet and let 'er go  
We're outward bound to Backalow  

I thought I heard the Old Man say  
It's one more pull and then belay
