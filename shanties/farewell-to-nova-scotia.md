title: Farewell To Nova Scotia  
---  
  
The sun was setting in the West  
The birds were singing on every tree  
All nature seemed inclined to rest  
But still there was no rest for me  
  
**So farewell to Nova Scotia, your sea-bound coast**  
**Let your mountains dark and drear-y be**  
**For when I am far away on the briny ocean tossed**  
**Will you ever heave a sigh or a wish for me?**  
  
I grieve to leave my native land  
I grieve to leave my comrades all  
And my parents whom I held so dear  
And the bonny bonny lassie that I do adore  
  
Well the drums do beat and the wars do alarm  
My captain calls, I must obey  
So farewell, farewell to Nova Scotia's charms  
For it's early in the morning I'll be far far away  
  
I have three brothers, they are at rest  
Their arms are folded on their breast  
But a poor simple sailor just like me  
Must be tossed and driven on the dark blue sea  
  
_(after final chorus)_  
***Won't you keep a watch on Nova Scotia's shores for me?***
