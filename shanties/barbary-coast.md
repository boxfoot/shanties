---  
title: The Coast Of High Barbary  
---  
  
Look ahead, look astern,  
Look the weather and the lee  
**Blow high! Blow low! And so sailed we**  
I see a wreck to windward,  
And a lofty ship to lee,  
**A-sailing down along the coast of High Barbary**  
  
"Oh, are you a pirate  
Or a man-o'-war?" cried he...  
"Oh no, we are not men of war,  
But pirates, brave and free!" ...  
  
Well back up your topsails  
And heave your vessel to...  
For we have got some letters  
To be carried home by you...  
  
We'll back up our topsails  
And heave our vessel to...  
But only in some harbour  
And along the side of you...  
  
For broadside for broadside  
We fought all on the main...  
Until at last the pirate  
Shot the frigate's mast away...  
  
"For quarters! For quarters!"  
The saucy sailors cried...  
The quarters that we showed them  
Was to sink them in the tide...  
  
With cutlass and gun  
Oh, we fought for hours three...  
Their ship it was their coffin,  
And their grave it was the sea...
