title: Paddy on the Railway
---

In eighteen hundred and forty one  
Me corduroy britches I put on  
Me corduroy britches I put on  
To work upon the railway

**Tirramy oh re oh re ay**  
**Tirramy oh re oh re ay**  
**Tirramy oh re oh re ay**  
**To work upon the railway**

In eighteen hundred and forty two  
I left the old world for the new  
Bad cess to the luck that brought me through  
To work upon the railway

In eighteen hundred and forty three  
We hit Chicago on a spree  
The devil got a hold of me  
While working on the railway

In eighteen hundred and forty four  
While standing on the great big shore  
We laid a track and saw no more  
For working on the railway

In eighteen and hundred and forty five  
When Daniel O'Connell was alive  
In Kansas City we derived  
To work upon the railway

In eighteen hundred and forty six  
I'd a pain in me arse from carrying bricks  
With your hammers and nails and shovels and picks  
A-working on the railway

It's 'Paddy, do this' and 'Paddy do that'  
With doles of stock and our cravat  
And nothing but an old straw hat  
We're working on the railway

In eighteen hundred and forty eight  
Me hands did blister, me belly did ache  
We heard of gold and made a stake  
From working on the railway

In eighteen hundred and forty nine  
The California hills looked fine  
We found some gold and left behind  
The workings of the railway
