title: The Final Trawl  
---  
  
Now it's three long years since we made her pay  
**Haul away, me laddie-o**  
And the owners say that she's had her day  
**Sing haul away, me laddie-o**  

So it's heave away for the final trawl  
It's an easy pull, for the catch is small  

Now its stow your gear, lads, and batten down  
And I'll take the wheel, lads, and turn her round  

And we'll join "The Venture" and "The Morning Star"  
Riding high and empty towards the bar  

For I'd rather beach her on the skerry rock  
Than to see her torched in the breakers dock  

And when I die, you can stow me down  
In her rusty hold, where the breakers sound  

Then I'll make the haven of Fiddler's Green  
Where the grub is good and the bunks are clean  

For I've fished a lifetime, boy and man  
And the final trawl scarcely nets a cran  

So it's heave away for the final trawl  
It's an easy pull, for the catch is small
