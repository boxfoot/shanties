It was pleasant and delightful on a midsummer's morn  
Where the green fields and meadows were buried in the corn  
And the blackbirds and thrushes sang on every green tree  
And the larks they sang melodious at the dawning of the day  
**And the larks they sang melodious  
And the larks they sang melodious  
And the larks they sang melodious at the dawning of the day**

Well a sailor and his true love were out walking one day  
Said the sailor to his true love, "I am bound far away  
I am bound for the East Indies where the loud cannons roar  
**And I'm going to leavie my Nancy, she's the one that I adore"**

Then the ring from her finger she instantly drew  
Saying "take this dear Geordie and me heart will go too"  
And as he was embracing her tears from her eyes fell  
**Saying, "may I go along with you?" "Oh no, me love, farewell"**  

Said the Sailor to his true love "well I must be on me way  
The topsails are hoisted, and the anchors are weighed  
Our big ship lies waiting for to sail on the tide  
**And if ever I return again, I will make you my bride"**
