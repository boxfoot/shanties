title: Bold Privateer

Oh my dearest Molly, it's you and I must part  
I'm across the ocean, love - I'll leave you with my heart  
My ship is now awaiting, so fare thee well my dear  
I'm going onboard the vessel a bold privateer  
**Bold privateer, bold privateer**  
**I'm just now going onboard the bold privateer**  

Oh my dearest Johnny, great dangers have been wrought,  
And many's a sweet life on the sea has been lost  
Better stay at home with your charming Molly dear  
Then to venture your sweet life a bold privateer  
**Bold privateer, bold privateer**  
**Then to venture your sweet life a bold privateer**  

Oh my dearest Molly, your friends do me despise,  
Besides you have two brothers who'd freely take my life  
Come change your ring with me, dear love, come change your ring with me,  
And let it be a token when I'm across the sea  
**When I'm across the sea, when I'm across the sea**  
**And let it be a token when I'm across the sea.**  

And when the war is ended, should heaven spare my life  
I'll return again to my intended wife  
And then I'll get married to my charming Molly dear  
And forever bid adieu to the bold privateer  
**Bold privateer, bold privateer**  
**And forever bid adieu to the bold privateer.**
