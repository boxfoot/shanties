_With our nets and gear we're faring  
On the wild and wasteful ocean  
It's there on the deep that we harvest and reap our bread  
As we hunt the bonny shoals of herring_

It was on a fair and a pleasant day  
Out of Yarmouth harbor I was faring  
As a cabin boy on a sailing lugger  
**For to hunt the bonny shoals of herring**

Now the work was hard and the hours were long  
And the treatment sure it took some bearing  
There was little kindness and the kicks were many  
**As we hunted for the shoals of herring**  

Oh we left the home grounds in the month of June  
And for canny Shiels we soon were bearing  
With a hundred cran of the silver darlings  
**That we'd taken from the shoals of herring**  

Oh we fished the Swarth and the Broken Bank  
I was a cook and I'd a quarter's sharing  
And I used to sleep standing on me feet  
**And I'd dream about the shoals of herring**

Now you're up on deck, you're a fisherman  
You can swear and show a manly bearing  
Take your turn on watch with the other fellows  
**While you're following the shoals of herring**  

In the stormy seas and the living gales  
Just to earn the gear that I was wearing  
Sailed ten thousand miles, caught ten million fishes  
**We was out there hunting shoals of herring**  

_And it's night and day we're faring  
Come winter wave or winter gale  
Sweating or cold; growing up, growing old [and dying]  
As we hunt the bonnie shoals of herring_
