Haul on the bowline, my Kitty comes from Liverpool  
**Haul on the bowline, the bowline, haul!**  
  
Haul on the bowline, Liverpool's a fine townâ€¦  
  
Haul on the bowline, Kitty's on the game again  
  
Haul on the bowline, the good ship is a-rolling  
  
Haul on the bowline, the old man is a-growling  
  
Haul on the bowline, we'll either break or bend her  
  
Haul on the bowline, we're man enough to mend her  
  
Haul on the bowline, and bust the chafing leather  
  
Haul on the bowline, we'll hang for finer weather
