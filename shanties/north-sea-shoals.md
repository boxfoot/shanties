title: The North Sea Shoals  
---  
  
Come all you gallant fishermen that plough the stormy sea,  
The whole year round on the fishing grounds  
On the Northern Minch and the Norway Deeps,  
On the banks and knolls of the North Sea Holes  
Where the herring shoals are found.  
It's there you'll find the Norfolk boys and the lads from Peterhead,  
There's Buckie chiels and men from Shields,  
On the Northern Minch and the Norway Deeps,  
On the banks and knolls of the North Sea Holes  
Where the herring shoals are found.  
From Fraserborough and Aberdeen, from Whitby, Yarmouth Town,  
The fleet's away at the break of day  
To the Northern Minch and the Norway Deeps,  
To the banks and knolls of the North Sea Holes  
Where the herring shoals are found.  

It's off with a boiler full of steam and your engine spic and span  
To fish the grounds the North Sea round  
And fish and knolls and the North Sea Holes  
And try your luck at the North Shields Gut  
With a catch of a hundred cran.  
No need to wait for the wind and tide, you're the master of the sea,  
Come calm or squall, just shoot and haul  
And fill the hold with the fish to be sold  
And steam ahead for the curing shed  
And the buyers on the Yarmouth quay.  
Come all you gallant fishermen that plough the stormy sea,  
The whole year round on the fishing grounds  
On the Northern Minch and the Norway Deeps,  
On the banks and knolls of the North Sea Holes  
Where the herring shoals are found.
