I have done my bit of carving,  
Figureheads of quaint design,  
For the Olives and the Ruddocks,  
And the famous Black Ball Line.  
Brigantines and barques and clippers,  
Brigs and schooners, lithe and tall,  
But the bounding _Marco Polo_  
Was the proudest of them all.  

**While my hands are steady, while my hands are good**  
**I will carve the music of the wind into the wood**  
 
I can see that white-winged clipper  
Reeling under scudding clouds,  
Tramping down a hazy sky-line,  
With a Norther in her shrouds.  
I can feel her lines of beauty,  
See her flecked with spume and brine,  
As she drives her scuppers under,  
And that figurehead of mine.

'Twas of seasoned pine I made it,  
Clear from outer bark to core,  
And the finest piece of timber  
From the mast-pond on Straight Shore.  
Every bite of axe or chisel,  
Every ringing mallet welt  
Brought from out that block of timber  
All the spirit that I felt.  

I had read of Marco Polo  
Till his daring deeds were mine,  
And I saw them all aglowing  
In that balsam-scented pine;  
Saw his eyes alight with purpose,  
Facing every vagrant breeze;  
Saw him lilting, free and careless,  
Over all the Seven Seas.

That was how I did my carving;  
Beat of heart and stroke of hand  
Blended into life and action  
All the purpose that I planned;  
Flowing robes and wind-tossed tresses,  
Forms of beauty, strength, designâ€”  
Saw them all, and strove to carve them  
In those figureheads of mine.  

I am old, my hands are feeble,  
And my outward eyes are dim,  
But I see again those clippers  
Lifting o'er the ocean's rim;  
Great white fleet of reeling rovers,  
Wind above and surf beneath,  
And the _Marco Polo_ leading  
With my carving in her teeth.
