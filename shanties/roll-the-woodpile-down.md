title: Roll The Woodpile Down  
---  
  
Oh way down south where the cocks do crow  
**Way down in Florida**  
Them girls all dance to the old banjo  
**And we'll roll the woodpile down!**  

**Rollin'! (Rollin'!) Rollin'! (Rollin'!)**  
**Rollin' the whole world 'round**  
**That brown girl of mine on the Georgia Line**  
**And we'll roll the woodpile down!**  

When I was a young man in me prime…  
I'd chase them yeller girls two at a time…  

We'll roll him high and we'll roll him low  
We'll heave him up and away we'll go  

Oh, roust and bust her is the cry  
A sailor's wage is never high  

O Curly goes on the ol' ran-tan  
O Curly's jist a Down-East man  

Oh one more heave and that'll do  
For we're the bullies to kick her through
