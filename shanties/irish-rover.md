title: The Irish Rover  
---  
  
In the year of our Lord eighteen hundred and six  
We set sail from the Coal Quay of Cork  
We were sailing away with a cargo of bricks  
For the grand City Hall in New York  
We'd an elegant craft, it was rigged 'fore and aft  
And how the trade winds drove her  
She had twenty-three masts and she stood several blasts  
And they called her the Irish Rover  

There was Barney Magee from the banks of the Lee  
There was Hogan from County Tyrone  
There was Johnny McGurk who was scared stiff of work  
And a chap from Westmeath named Malone  
There was Slugger O'Toole, who was drunk as a rule  
And fighting Bill Tracy from Dover  
And your man Mick McCann, from the banks of the Bann  
Was the skipper on the Irish Rover  

There was awl Mickey Coote, who played hard on his flute  
When the ladies lined up for his set  
He was tooting with skill for each sparkling quadrille  
Though the dancers were fluttered and bet  
With his sparse, witty talk he was cock of the walk  
As he rolled the dames under and over  
They all knew at a glance when he took off his pants  
That he sailed in the Irish Rover  

We had one million bags of the best Sligo rags  
We had two million barrels of bone  
We had three million bales of old nanny goats' tails  
We had four million barrels of stone  
We had five million hogs and six million dogs  
And seven million barrels of porter  
We had eight million sides of old blind horses' hides  
In the hold of the Irish Rover  

We had sailed seven years when the measles broke out  
And our ship lost her way in a fog  
And a whale of a crew was reduced down to two  
'Twas myself and the captain's old dog  
Then the ship struck a rock, oh, Lord what a shock  
And nearly tumbled over  
She turned nine times around, then the poor old dog was drowned  
I'm the last of the Irish Rover
