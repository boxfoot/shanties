Call me the whale, for that's what I am  
And a whale I always will be  
You may call yourself king of the land  
I am the king of the sea, **brave boys**  
**I'm the king of the sea**  

I never meant to do you any harm, brave boys  
When I took you to the bottom with my tail  
I only meant to show you you should have been at home  
Instead of on the ocean chasing whales, **brave boys**  
**Instead of on the ocean chasing whales**  

But you didn't get the message, so more and more you came  
Till I ran out of places to hide  
And your boats got so big I couldn't take you down  
I knew then you had turned the tide, **brave boys**  
**I knew then you had turned the tide**  

You hunt me down with your factory ships  
And you never even touch me with your hands  
In the morning I'm playing with my babies in the waves  
In the evenings I'm packed into your cans, **brave boys**  
**In the evenings I'm packed into your cans**  

You have become so efficient with your instruments of death  
By now I'm barely alive  
But if you treat each other in the way you've treated me  
I think I am going to survive, **brave boys**  
**I think I'm going to survive**  

Call me the whale, for that's what I am  
And a whale I always will be  
You may call yourself king of the land  
I am the king of the sea, **brave boys**  
**I'm the king of the sea**
