**Help me, Bob, I'm bully in the alley**  
**Way, hey, bully in the alley**  
**Help me, Bob, I'm bully in the alley**  
**Bully down in Shinbone Al'**  

Well, Sally is the girl that I love dearly  
**Way, hey, bully in the alley**  
Sally is the girl that I'd splice nearly  
**Bully down in Shinbone Al'**  

For seven long years I courted Sally…  
All she did was dilly in the dally…  

I bought her silks, I bought her laces  
I took her out to all the fine places  

Well, I'll leave Sal and I'll be a sailor  
I'll leave Sal and ship aboard a whaler  

When I get back I'll marry Sally  
We'll have kids and count them by the tally
