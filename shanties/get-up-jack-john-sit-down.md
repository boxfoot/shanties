title: Get Up Jack, John Sit Down  
---  
  
Well ships may come and ships may go, as long as the seas do roll  
And a sailor lad, just like his dad, he loves his rum and bowl  
Now a lass ashore he do adore, a woman who's plump and round  
But when your money's all gone it's the same old song:

**Get up Jack, John sit down!**  
**Come along, come along me jolly brave boys**  
**There's plenty more grog in the jar**  
**We'll plow the briny ocean with a jolly roving tar**  

When Jack's ashore he'll make his way to some old boarding house  
He's welcomed in with rum and gin, likewise with fork and scouse  
And he'll spend and he'll spend and never offend, 'til he lies drunk on the ground…  

Then Jack will slip aboard a ship bound for India or Japan  
In Asia there, the ladies fair all love a sailor man  
He'll go ashore and he won't scorn to buy some maid a gown…  

When Jack is old and weather-beat, too old to sail about  
They'll let him stop at some grog shop 'til eight bells calls him out  
Then he'll raise his glass high, and loudly he'll cry "Thank God I'm homeward bound…"
