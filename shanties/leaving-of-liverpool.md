---  
title: The Leaving Of Liverpool  
---  
  
Farewell to Prince's landing stage  
Mersey River, fare thee well  
I am bound for Californ-i-ay  
A place I know right well  

**So fare thee well my own true love**  
**And when I return, united we will be**  
**It's not the leaving of Liverpool that grieves me**  
**But my darling when I think of thee**  

I am bound for Californ-i-ay  
By the way of the stormy Cape Horn  
And I'll write to you a letter, love  
When I am homeward bound  

I have signed on a Yankee clipper ship  
Davy Crockett is her name  
And Burgess is the captain of her  
And they say she is a floating shame  

I have sailed with Burgess once before  
And I think I know him right well  
If a man is a sailor, he can get along  
But if not than he's surely in hell  

Oh, the fog is on the harbor love  
And I wish I could remain  
But I know it will be some long time  
Before I see you again
