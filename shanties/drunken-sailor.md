What do you do with a drunken sailor? (3x)  
**Early in the morning**

**Way, hey, up she rises** (3x)  
**Early in the morning**  

Put him in the long boat 'til he's sober  

Put him in the bilge and make him drink it  

Put him in a leaky boat and make him bail her  

Tie him to the scuppers with the hose pipe on him  

Shave his belly with a rusty razor  

Tie him to the topmast while she's yardarm under  

Heave him by the leg in a runnin' bowline  

Keel haul him 'til he's sober  

Put him in the cabin with the captain's daughter  

Went to sea with a drunken sailor  
Six long months in a leaky whaler  
Put him in the hold and made him bail 'er  
**Early in the morning**  

That's what you do with a drunken sailor!
