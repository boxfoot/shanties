title: The Dreadnaught

There is a flash packet and a packet of fame  
She hails from New York and the _Dreadnaught_'s her name  
She's bound to the west where the wide waters flow!  
Bound away to the westward in the _Dreadnaught_ we go  
**Derry down, down, down derry down.**  
  
The time of her sailing is now drawing nigh  
Farewell pretty maids, we must bid you goodbye  
A pair of clean heels now to you we will show  
Bound away in the _Dreadnaught_ to the westward we go  
  
Now the _Dreadnaught_ is lying in the river Mercy  
Awaiting the tugboat to tow her to sea  
For to round the rock light where the salt tides do flow  
Bound away in the _Dreadnaught_ to the westward we go  
  
Now the _Dreadnaught_'s a-bowlin down the wild Irish Sea  
Her passengers merry; their hearts full of glee  
Her sailors like tigers walk the decks to and fro  
Bound away in the _Dreadnaught_ to the westward we go  
  
Now the _Dreadnaught_'s a-sailing the Atlantic so wide  
While the dark, heavy seas roll along her black sides,  
With her tops'ls set taut for the red cross to show  
Bound away in the _Dreadnaught_ to the westward we go  
  
Now the _Dreadnaught_'s arriving in old New York town  
We're bound for the bow'ry and let sorrow drown  
With our gals and our beer, boys we'll let the song flow!  
She's a saucy flash packet; oh lord let her go!  
  
Here's a health to the _Dreadnaught_ and all her brave crew  
To bold captain Samuels and his officers too  
You may talk of your fliers, Swallowtail, and Black Ball  
But the _Dreadnaught_'s the packet that out-sails them all!
