**(S)he was the captain of the Nightingale**  
**Twenty-one days from Clyde in coal**  
**(S)he could smell the flowers of Bermuda in the gale**  
**When (s)he died on the North Rock shoal**  

Just five short hours from Bermuda  
In a fine October gale  
There came a cry, " Oh, there be breakers dead ahead  
From the collier Nightingale  

No sooner had the captain brought her round,  
Came a rending crash below  
Hard on her beam ends groaning, went the Nightingale  
And o'erside her mainmast goes  

"O captain are we all for drowning,"  
Came a cry from all the crew  
"The boats be smashed! How are we all then to be saved?  
They are stove in through and through  

O are ye brave and hardy colliermen  
Or are you blind and cannot see  
The captain's gig still lies before ye whole and sound  
And it shall carry all of we  

But when the crew was all assembled  
And the gig prepared for sea  
'Twas seen there were but eighteen places to be manned  
Nineteen mortal souls were we  

But cries the captain, _"Now do not delay_  
_Nor do you spare a thought for me_  
_My duty is to save you all now if I can_  
_See ye return quick as can be!"_  

Oh, there be flowers in Bermuda  
Beauty lies on every hand  
And there be laughter ease and drink for every man  
But there is no joy for me  

For when we reached the wretched Nightingale  
What an awful sight was plain  
The captain, drowned, was tangled in the mizzen chains  
Smiling bravely beneath the sea
