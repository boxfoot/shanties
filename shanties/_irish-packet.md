title: Black Is The Color Of My True Love's Hair  
---  
  

Black is the color of my true love's hair  
Her lips are red like some roses fair  
The purest eyes and the gentlest hands  
I love the ground whereon she stands  
I go to Clyde for to mourn and weep  
But satisfied I never can sleep  
I'll write to you in a few short lines  
I'll suffer death ten thousand times  
I love my love and well she knows  
I love the grass whereon she goes  
If she on earth no more I see  
My life will quickly fade away  
_Optional:_  
_(A winter's past and the leaves are green_  
_The time has past that we have seen_  
_But still I pray the time will come_  
_When she and I will be as one)_  
Black is the color of my true love's hair  
Her lips are like some roses fair  
The purest eyes and the gentlest hands  
I love the ground whereon she stands

title: Black Velvet Band  
---  

In a neat little town they call Belfast  
Apprenticed to trade I was bound  
And many an hour's sweet happiness  
I spent in that neat little town  
'Til sad misfortune befell me  
And caused me to stray from the land  
Far away from my friends and relations  
To follow the black velvet band  
**Her eyes they shone like the diamonds**  
**You'd think she was queen of the land**  
**And her hair hung over her shoulder**  
**Tied up with a black velvet band**  
When I was out strolling one evening  
Not meaning to go very far  
When I met with a frolicsome damsel  
She was plying her trade in a bar  
When a watch she took from a customer  
And slipped it right into my hand  
Then the law came and put me in prison  
Bad luck to the Black Velvet Band  
Next morning before judge and jury  
At trial I had to appear  
The judge says to me, "me young fellow  
The case against you is quite clear  
And seven long years is your sentence  
You're going to Van Diemen's Land  
Far away from your friends and relations  
To follow the black velvet band"  
So come all you jolly young fellows  
I'll have you take warning by me  
Whenever you're out on the liquor, me boys  
Beware of the pretty colleens  
They'll fill you with whiskey and porter  
'Til you are not able to stand  
And the very next thing that you know, me lads  
You've landed in Van Diemen's Land

title: Wild Rover  
---  
  
I've played the Wild Rover for many a year  
And I've spent all my money on whiskey and beer  
But now I'm returning with gold in great store  
And I never will play the Wild Rover no more.  
  
**And it's no, nay, never** _[hike up your kilt]_  
**No nay never no more**  
**Will I play the Wild Rover**  
**No never, no more.**  
  
I went to an alehouse I used to frequent  
And I told the landlady me money was spent  
I asked her for credit, she answered me, "Nay,"  
"Such custom as yours I could have any day!"  
  
I took from me pocket ten sovereigns bright  
And the landlady's eyes opened wide with delight  
She said, "I have whiskeys, and wines of the best,  
And the words that I told you was only in jest!"  
  
I'll return to my parents, confess what I've done  
And ask them to pardon their prodigal son  
And when they forgive me, as oft' times before  
Then I never will play the Wild Rover no more.
