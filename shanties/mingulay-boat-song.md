title: Mingulay Boat Song  
---  
  
**Heel ya ho, boys, let her go, boys,**  
**Heave her head 'round into the weather**  
**Heel ya ho, boys, let her go, boys,**  
**Sailing homeward to Mingulay**  

What care we how white the minch is  
What care we for the wind and weather  
For we know that every inch is  
Sailing closer to Mingulay  

Wives are waiting at the pierhead  
Looking seaward into the weather  
Heave her 'round, boys, and we'll anchor  
E'er the sun sets on Mingulay  

Far beyond the straits of Coolie,  
We can see our own land of heather,  
And you know, boys, candles glow, boys  
Lighting the windows of Mingulay  

Ships return now, heavy laden  
Mothers holdin' their bairns a-cryin'  
We'll return though, when the sun sets,  
We'll return then to Mingulay
