We crossed the wild pecos  
We forded the nueces  
We swum the guadalupe  
And we followed the brazos  
Red river runs rusty  
The wichita clear  
But down by the brazos  
I courted my dear  
  
**Singing li, li, li, le, le, le**  
**Lend me your hand**  
**Li, li, li, le, le, le**  
**Lend me your hand**  
**Li, li, li, le, le, le**  
**Lend me your hand**  
**There's many a river**  
**That waters the land**  
  
Now the fair angelina  
Runs glossy and gliding  
The crooked colorado  
Runs weaving and winding  
The slow san antonio  
Courses and plains  
But I never will walk  
By the brazos again  
  
She kissed me and she hugged me  
And she called me her dandy  
The trinity's muddy  
But the brazos quick sandy  
She kissed me and she hugged me  
And she called me her own  
But down by the brazos  
She left me alone  
  
Now the girls of little river  
They're plump and they're pretty  
The sabine and the sulphur  
Hold beauties a'many  
The banks of the neches  
There are girls by the score  
But down by the brazos  
I'll wander no more
