title: A Professional Pirate  
---  
  
When I was just a lad looking for my true vocation  
My father said "Now son, this choice deserves deliberation  
Though you could be a doctor or perhaps a financier  
My boy why not consider a more challenging career"  
Hey ho ho  
You'll cruise to foreign shores  
And you'll keep your mind and body sound  
By working out of doors  
True friendship and adventure are what we can't live without  
And when you're a professional pirate  
That's what the job's about  
Now take Sir Francis Drake, the Spanish all despise him  
But to the British he's a hero and they idolize him  
It's how you look at buccaneers that makes them bad or good  
And I see us as members of a noble brotherhood  
Hey ho ho  
We're honorable men  
And before we lose our tempers we will always count to ten  
On occasion there may be someone you have to execute  
But when you're a professional pirate  
You don't have to wear a suit.....what?  
I could have been a surgeon  
I like taking things apart  
I could have been a lawyer  
But I just had too much heart  
I could have been in politics  
Cause I've always been a big spender  
And me...I could have been a contender  
Some say that pirates steal and should be feared and hated  
I say we're victims of bad press it's all exaggerated  
We'd never stab you in the back, we'd never lie or cheat  
We're just about the nicest guys you'd ever want to meet  
Hey ho ho  
It's one for all for one  
And we'll share and share alike with you and love you like a son  
We're gentlemen of fortune and that's what we're proud to be  
And when you're a professional pirate  
You'll be honest brave and free  
The soul of decency  
You'll be loyal and fair and on the square  
And most importantly  
When you're a professional pirate  
You're always in the best of company
