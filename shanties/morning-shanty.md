title: Morning Shanty  
---  
  
Won't you come down to the shore  
**Watching**  
I will sail away once more  
**In the morning** 

We have sung through half the night  
**Watching**  
For the coming of the light  
**In the morning**  

For the friends who now have gone  
**Watching**  
For the friends returning home  
**In the morning**  

But the clock upon the wall  
**Watching**  
Steals the time and gives it all  
**To the morning**  

At my window I will be  
**Watching**  
For your ships to sail to me  
**In the morning**
