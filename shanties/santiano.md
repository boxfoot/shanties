Oh, Santiano gained the day  
**Away Santiano**   
Oh, Santiano gained the day  
**All on the plains of Mexico**  

To Mexico, oh Mexico    
To Mexico, where I must go  

O! Santiano had a wooden leg  
He used it for a cribbage peg  

O! Santiano fought for his gold  
The deeds he did have oft been told  

He won the day at Molly-Del-Rey,  
And General Taylor he ran away.  

O! Santiano fought for his life,  
He gained his way in the terrible strife.  

O! Santiano's men were brave,  
Many found a hero's grave.  

O! Santiano's day is o'er,  
Santiano will fight no more.  

O! Santiano's day is gorn,  
We left him buried off Cape Horn.  

We dug his grave with a golden spade,  
And marked the spot where he was laid.
