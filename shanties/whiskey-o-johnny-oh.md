Whiskey is the life of man, I'll drink whiskey when I can  

**Whiskey-o, Johnny-o**  
**Rise her up from down below**  
**Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey-o**  
**Up aloft this yard must go**  
**John rise her up from down below**  

I like whiskey hot and strong, I'll drink whiskey all day longâ€¦  

I'll drink it hot, I'll drink it cold, I'll drink it new, I'll drink it old  

Whiskey made me sell my coat, whiskey's what keeps me afloat  

Whiskey killed my sister Sue, whiskey killed my brother, too  

If whiskey was a river and I was a duck, I'd dive to the bottom and never come up  

I wish I knew where whiskey grew, I'd eat the leaves and the branches too  

Some likes whiskey, some likes beer, I wish I had a barrel here  

Whiskey caused an awkward pause  ...

Whiskey made the bosun call "hang together, one and all"  

Whiskey stole my brains away, one more pull and we'll belay  

A glass of grog for every man and a barrel full for the shantyman!
