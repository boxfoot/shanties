Well it's not the hours of watch on watch and it's not the work that I mind so much  
Or the long cold miles from my lover's touch, though for sure she's far away  
No stranger I to the touch of steel, nor the honest fear any man can feel  
But I long for dust under my heels and a pocket full of pay  
So I'll take it from day to day  

The pack-ice 'round us cracks and groans, the old St. Roch, she creaks and moans  
The icy fog is in my bones and the ache won't go away  
Outside I bet it's warm and fair, I could have her fingers in my hair  
But it's long cold miles to her out there, so I guess I'll have to stay  
And just take it from day to day  

We're as far north now as I want to come, but Larson's got us under his thumb  
And I signed up for the whole damn run, I can't get off halfway  
But when I get back onto the shore I'm going south where it stays warm  
And there'll be someone on my arm to help me spend my pay  
So I'll take it from day to day _(repeat final verse)_
