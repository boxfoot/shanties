**On a Monday morning in the month of May**  
I thought I heard the old man say  
The Rosabella sails today

**I'm goin' on board the Rosabella**  
**I'm goin' on board the Rosabella**  
**I'm going on board, right down to board**  
**The saucy Rosabella**

She's a deep water ship with a deep water crew  
**She's a deep water ship with a deep water crew**  
You can stick to the coast but we're damned if we do  
Aboard the Rosabella

All around Cape Horn in the month of May  
**All around Cape Horn in the month of May**  
It's around Cape Horn it's a bloody long way  
On board the Rosabella

Those Galway girls do make me grieve  
**Those Galway girls do make me grieve**  
They spent my money and made me leave  
On board the Rosabella

On a Monday morning in the month of May  
**On a Monday morning in the month of May**  
I thought I heard the old man say  
The Rosabella sails today
