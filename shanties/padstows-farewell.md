aka: 
  - Haul Away Your Anchor
---

It is time to go now  
Haul away your anchor  
Haul away your anchor  
It's our sailing time  

Get some sail up on her  
Haul away your halyards  
Haul away your halyards  
It's our sailing time  

Get her on her course now  
Haul away your foresheets  
Haul away your foresheets  
It's our sailing time  

Waves are surging under  
Haul away down channel  
Haul away down channel  
On the evening tide  

When your sailing's over  
Haul away for Heaven  
Haul away for Heaven  
God be by your side
