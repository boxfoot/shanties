Well the hardest packet you'll ever find  
**Ra hey ra ho are you most done**  
Is the old _Wildcat_ of the Swallowtail line  
**Clear away the track and let the bullgine run**  

**Hey rig a jig in the low back car**  
**Ra hey ra ho are you most done**  
**Liza Lee all on my knee**  
**Clear away the track and let the bullgine run**  

Well Eliza Lee if you were mine  
I would dress you up in silk so fine  

Well the prettiest sight you'll ever see  
Is Eliza Lee all on my knee  

Well in Liverpool town them girls hang 'round  
And it's there Eliza can be found  

And when we get to Liverpool town  
I will stand you whiskey all around  

Well when I come home from across the sea  
Oh, Eliza Lee will you marry me?  

Well I'll stay with you upon the shore  
And it's back to sea I'll go no more
