**Sweet Minerva waits for me,**  
**Anchor down and homeward bound**  
**Heading for St Andrew’s Quay,**  
**Sweet Minerva, set me free.**

Heavy rain from Humber skies  
Wipe the water from my eyes.  
My love’s clearly in my mind.  
Glad to leave this trawl behind.

Captive north of Killingholme  
Wanting so much to be home,  
Prisoner of the waiting tide,  
Home and heart are still denied.

Kingston nights shine bright once more,  
Diamond lights and dazzling shore,  
Smoke house terrace all my own,  
Hessle Road and harbour home.

See my woman standing by,  
See that rare look in her eye.  
Tonight I’ll keep her close to me,  
Forget the trials of the sea.

Settling done and some to spare,  
Pay the ovel man his share,  
Two days on, then back to sea,  
Arctic waters wait for me.
