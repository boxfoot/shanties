Six o'clock I hear 'em say  
**Sun down, sun down below**  
Time to quit and go away  
**Sun down, sun down below**  

**A-a-a-a-aye**  
**Sun down, sun down below**  
**A-a-a-a-aye**  
**Sun down, sun down below**  

Sun is down in the hole below...  
Time for us to roll and go  

Thought I heard my captain say...  
Sun is down; go get your pay  

Pack your duds and dinner pail...  
Come back sure before we sail  

Six o'clock; I heard them say...  
Time for us to go away
