title: I'se The B'y

I's the b'y that builds the boat  
And I's the b'y that sails her  
I's the b'y that catches the fish  
And takes 'em home to 'Lizer  

**Hip your partner, Sally Tibbo**  
**Hip your partner, Sally Brown**  
**Fogo, Twillingate, Morton's Harbour**  
**All around the circle**  

Sods and rinds to cover your flake  
Cake and tea for supper  
Codfish in the spring o' the year  
Fried in maggoty butter  

I don't want your maggoty fish  
That's no good for winter  
I could buy as good as that  
Down in Bonavista  

I took 'Lizer to a dance  
And faith, but she could travel  
And every step that she did take  
Was up to her knees in gravel  

Susan White, she's out of sight  
Her petticoat wants a border  
Old Sam Oliver in the dark  
He kissed her in the corner
