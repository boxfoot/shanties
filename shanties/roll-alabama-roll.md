When the Alabama's keel was laid,  
**Roll, Alabama, roll!**  
It was laid in the yard of Jonathan Laird.  
**Roll, roll, Alabama, roll!**  

Down the Mersey ways she rolled then;  
Liverpool fitted her with guns and men.  

From the Western Isles she sailed forth,  
To destroy the commerce of the North.  

The Alabama sailed for two whole years,  
Took sixty-five ships in her career.  

With British guns, oh, she was stocked;  
She sailed from Fayal; in Cherbourg she docked.  

To Cherbourg port she sailed one day  
 To collect her share of the prize money.  

But off Cherbourg the Kearsarge lay tight,  
With Cap'n Winslow spoilin' for a fight. 

Many a sailor lad saw his doom,  
When the Yankee Kearsarge hove in view.  

'Twas a ball from the forward pivot that day,  
Shot the Alabama's keel away.  

Off the three-mile limit, in sixty-four,  
They sent the Alabama to the cold ocean floor.  

When the Alabama's keel was laid,  
It was laid in the yard of Jonathan Laird.
