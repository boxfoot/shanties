**Way hey and away we go**  
**Donkey riding, donkey riding**  
**Way hey and away we go**  
**Ridin' on a donkey.**  

Was you ever in Quebec  
Launchin' timber on the deck?  
Where ya break yer bleedin' neck  
**Ridin' on a donkey!**  

Was you ever 'round Cape Horn  
Where the weather's never warm?  
Wished to God you'd never been born  
**Ridin' on a donkey**  

Was you ever in Miramichi  
Where ye tie up to a tree,  
An' the girls sit on yer knee?  
**Ridin' on a donkey**  

Was you ever in Fortune Bay  
See the girls all shout, "Hooray!  
Here comes dad with ten weeks pay"\
**Riding on a donkey**

Was you ever in London-town  
See the King he does come down?  
See the King in his golden crown!\
