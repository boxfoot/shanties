Ben Backstay was our boatswain, a very merry boy    
For no one half so merrily, could pipe all hands ahoy  
And when unto his summons, we did not well attend  
No lad than he more merrily, could handle the rope's end  
**Could han-dle the ropes end, could han-dle the rope's end**  

**Singing chip chow cherry chow fol de riddle idle  ow**  
**Chip chow cherry chow fol de riddle day (x2)**  

While sailing once our Captain, who was a jolly dog  
Served out to all our company, a double share of grog    
Ben Backstay he got tipsy, all to his heart's content  
And he being half seas over, boys, right overboard he went  
**Right o-ver-board he went, right overboard he went**

A shark was on the starboard bow, and sharks no man can stand    
For they do grapple everything, just like your sharks on land  
We heaved Ben out some tackling, to give his life some hope   
But as the shark bit his head off, so he couldn't see the rope  
**So he couldn't see the rope, he couldn't see the rope**  

Without his head his ghost appeared, all on the briny lake    
He piped all hands ahoy and cried, "Lads warning by me take  
By drinking grog I lost my life, and you my fate could meet  
So never mix your rum me lads, but always take them neat  
**But al-ways take them neat, but always take them neat**
