    According to [a discussion at Mainly Norfolk](http://mainlynorfolk.info/lloyd/songs/thebonnyshipthediamond.html),
    this ballad was written only a few years before all the ships mentioned in the third verse (except the _Eliza Swan_)
    were destroyed in a whaling expedition.  There wasn't a ship called _The Battler_ -- this probably
    refers to _The Rattler of the Leigh_.

The _Diamond_ is a ship, me lads, for the Davis Strait she's bound  
And the quay it is all garnished with the bonnie lassies round  
Captain Thompson gives the orders to sail the whole world wide  
Where the sun it never sets, me lads, nor darkness dims the sky  

**And it's cheer up, me lads, let your hearts never fail**  
**For the bonnie ship The _Diamond_ goes a-fishin' for the whale**  

Along the quay at Peterhead where the lassies stand around  
With their shawls all pulled about them and the salt tears running down  
Now don't you weep my bonnie lass, though we leave you behind  
For the rose will grow on Greenland's banks before we change our mind  

Here's a health to the _Resolution_, likewise the _Eliza Swan_  
Here's a health to the _Battler of the Montrose_ and the _Diamond_, ship of fame  
We wear the trousers of the white and the jackets of the blue  
When we come home to Peterhead, we'll have sweethearts in you

It will be bright both day and night when the Greenland lads come home  
With a ship that's full of oil, me lads, and money of our own  
We'll make the cradles for to rock and the blankets for to tear  
And every lass in Peterhead sings "Hushabye, my dear"
