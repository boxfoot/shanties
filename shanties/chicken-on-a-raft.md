title: Chicken On A Raft  
---  
  
Skipper's in the wardroom drinking gin  
**Hi ho, chicken on a raft**  
I don't mind knocking, but I ain't going in!  
**Hi ho, chicken on a raft**  
The Jimmy's laughing like a drain,  
**Hi ho, chicken on a raft**  
He's looking at me "comic cuts" again!  
**Hi ho, chicken on a raft**  

**Chicken on a raft on a Monday morning**  
**Oh, what a terrible sight to see**  
**Dabtoe's for'ard and the dustman's aft**  
**Sittin' there pickin' at a chicken on a raft**  
**Hi ho, chicken on a raft** (4x)

Gave me the middle and the forenoon too  
And now I'm pulling in the whaler's crew  
Seagulls wheeling overhead  
I oughter be home in me featherbed  

I had a little girl in Donny-Bee  
And did she make a fool of me  
Her heart was like a pusser's shower,  
Run hot to cold in a quarter of an hour  

An Amazon girl lived in Dumfries  
Only had her kids in twos and threes  
Her sister lives in Maryhill  
Says she won't, but I think she will! (And I respect her free will!)  

We kissed goodbye on the midnight bus
She didn't cry, she didn't fuss
Am I the man that she loves best?
Or am I just a cuckoo in another man's nest?
