By the storm-torn shoreline a woman is standing  
The spray strung like jewels in her hair  
And the sea tore the rocks near the desolate landing  
as though it had known she stood there  

**But she has come down to condemn that wild ocean**  
**For the murderous loss of her man**  
**His boat sailed out on Wednesday morning**  
**And it's feared she's gone down with all hands**  

Oh and white were the wave-caps, and wild was their parting  
So fierce is the warring of love  
But she prayed to the gods, both of men and of sailors  
Not to cast their cruel nets o'er her love  

There's a school on the hill where the sons of dead fathers  
Are led toward tempests and gales  
Where their God-given wings are clipped close to their bodies  
And their eyes are bound-'round with ships' sails  

What force leads a man to a life filled with danger  
High on seas or a mile underground?  
It's when need is his master and poverty's no stranger  
And there's no other work to be found
