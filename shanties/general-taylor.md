General Taylor gained the day  
**Walk him along, John carry him along**  
General Taylor gained the day  
**Carry him to his burying ground**  

**To me way, hey, you stormy**  
**Walk him along, John carry him along**  
**To me way, hey, you stormy**  
**Carry him to his burying ground**  

We'll dig his grave with a silver spade…  
His shroud of the finest silk will be made…  

We'll lower him down on a golden chain  
On every inch we'll carve his name  

General Taylor he's all the go  
He's gone where the stormy winds won't blow  

General Taylor he's dead and he's gone  
General Taylor he's long dead and gone
