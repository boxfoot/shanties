**Ah for just one time I would take the Northwest Passage**  
**To find the hand of Franklin reaching for the Beaufort Sea**  
**Tracing one warm line through a land so wide and savage**  
**And make a Northwest Passage to the sea**  

Westward through the Davis Strait 'tis there 'twas said to lie  
The sea route to the Orient for which so many died  
Come seeking gold and glory, leaving weathered broken bones  
And a long forgotten lonely cairn of stones  

Three centuries thereafter, I take passage overland  
In the footsteps of brave Kelso, where his sea of flowers began  
Watching cities rise before me, then behind me sink again  
This tardiest explorer driving hard across the plain  

And through the night, behind the wheel, the mileage clicking west  
I think upon MacKenzie, David Thompson and the rest  
Who cracked the mountain ramparts and did show a path for me  
To race the roaring Fraser to the sea  

How then am I so different from the first men through this way?  
Like them I left a settled life, I threw it all away  
To seek a Northwest Passage at the call of many men  
To find there but the road back home again
