Michael Shewmaker notes: "The part of the river I’m singing about is right at the confluence of the Mississippi and Minnesota Rivers.  Everything is within walking distance of Pike Island.  If your going to read all the nonsense I write here, then I suggest pulling up a map... More annotations (including suggestions for which of these many verses to sing together) are posted [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jWSeCVxlZIrGmMTL0ZfdXXdabHC6ncYgf_o9CfEswFs/edit)"

Some claim that we are land-locked here  
**Water, boys, water**  
But I don't find that quite so clear  
**All around us water**  
For nearly two blocks from my home  
The Mississippi southward roams  
**Flowing to the sea**  
**Flowing to the sea**  
**Flowing to the sea**  
  
Lock Number One’s not very large  
it only holds one tug, one barge  
but nine miles in St. Paul’s heart  
that’s where the heavy traffic starts  
   
Along the banks by Crosby Lake  
The barred owl’s caltl you can’t mistake  
“who cooks for you” he’d like to know  
while you watch his river go  

Below the dam the waters dance  
and wandering lovers seek romance  
they’re searching for a love that lasts  
where troubled waters roll by fast  
   
In winter walk behind the falls  
For when it cold the water stalls.  
Beneath that glowing frozen sheet,  
we watch as solid water keeps  
   
The solstice rains have soaked the ground  
And straight-line winds blow tall trees down  
We sing from mem’ry in the dark  
And watch the streets for Noah’s Ark  
   
Now we can come to this old bar  
and sing of waters near and far  
But while you stand and drink your beer  
Please recall there’s water here.  
   
Now we drink in this old bar  
and sing of waters near and far  
but I intend to launch a craft  
a boat, canoe, a well build raft {and go}  
   
Half my or more I’ll spend  
Living in this river bend  
but for a season I would roam  
past other places I’ve called home {while}  

To Lake Itasca’s shores I go  
to dream upon that rivers flow  
past bridges, and farms, and city scenes  
St. Louis, Memphis, New Orleans  

A two-barge tow glides through the night  
Its guide-light sweeps our picnic site  
and for a mesmerizing beat  
it comes ashore right at our feet, and keeps  
   
Our first evening here at Mac  
We walked summit to the gorge and back  
Now most those friends live far away  
And I see the river every day
