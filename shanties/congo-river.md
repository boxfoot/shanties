title: Congo River  
---  
  
Was you ever on the Congo River?  
**Blow, boys, blow**  
Where fever makes the sailor shiver  
**Blow me bully boys, blow**  
  
A Yankee ship came down the river…  
Her masts and yards they shone like silver…  
  
How d'you know she's a Yankee clipper?  
By the blood an' guts that flow from her scuppers  
  
Yonder came the Arrow packet  
She fired her guns an' I heard the racket  
  
And who do you think was the skipper of her?  
It's old Bully Hayes; he's a sailor robber  
  
And who do you think was chief mate of her?  
Why Boss-eyed Bill the Bowery Bastard  
  
And what do you think that they had for breakfast?  
The starboard side of an old sou'wester  
  
And what do you think that they had for dinner?  
A monkey's heart and a donkey's liver  
  
And what do you think that they had for supper?  
Belaying pin pie and a roll in the scupper  
  
Blow today and blow tomorrow  
And blow me from this ship of sorrow  
  
Blow today and blow forever  
And blow me down the Congo River
