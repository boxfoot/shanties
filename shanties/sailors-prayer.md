Though my sails be torn and ragged and my mast be turned about  
Though the night wind chill me to my very soul  
Though the salt spray sting my eye and the stars no sight provide  
Give me just enough morning light to hold  
  
**I will not lie me down, this rain a-raging**  
**I will not lie me down in such a storm**  
**And if this night be unblessed, I shall not take my rest**  
**Until we reach another shore**  
  
If the only water left is just salt to quench my thirst  
I will drink the rain that falls so steady down  
If night's blindness be my gift, if there be thieves upon my drift  
I will praise the dark that shelters me from them  
  
If my friends be drained and weary and it seems their hopes are lost  
There's no need for their bones on this blackened bottom  
And if death wait just off the bow, we need not answer to him now  
We'll stand on and face the morning light without him
