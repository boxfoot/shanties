title: Rollin' Down To Old Maui  
---  
  
It's a damn tough life full of toil and strife we whalermen undergo  
And we don't give a damn when the whaling's done how hard the winds did blow  
'Cause we're homeward bound from the Arctic Ground with a good ship taut and free  
And we won't give a damn when we drink our rum with the girls of old Maui  

**Rollin' down to old Maui, me boys, rollin' down to old Maui**  
**We're homeward bound from the Arctic Ground, rollin' down to old Maui**  

Once more we sail with the northerly gale through the ice and wind and rain  
Them coconut fronds, them tropical lands, we soon shall see again  
Six hellish months we've passed away on the cold Kamchatka Sea,  
But now we're bound from the Arctic Ground, rollin' down to old Maui  

Once more we sail with the northerly gale towards our island home  
Our main mast sprung, our whaling done, and we ain't got far to roam  
Our stuns'l boom's been carried away, what care we for that sound  
A living gale is after us, thank God we're homeward bound  

How soft the breeze through the island trees, now the ice is far astern  
Them native maids in their island glades are awaiting our return  
Even now, their big brown eyes look out, hoping some fine day to see  
Our baggy sails running 'fore the gales, rollin' down to old Maui  

And now we're anchored in the bay, with kanakas all around  
With chants and sweet alo-o-o-has, they greet us homeward bound  
And now ashore, we'll have good friends, we'll paint the beaches red  
Awaken in the arms of an island maid with a **big fat achin' head**
