title: One More Day

Oh, have you heard the news, me Johnny  
**One more day**  
We're homeward bound tomorrow  
**One more day**

**Only one more day, me Johnny**  
**One more day**  
**Oh, rock and roll me over**  
**One more day**  

Don't you hear the old man growlin'  
Don't you hear the mate a howlin'  

Don't you hear the caps'n pawlin'  
Don't you hear the pilot bawlin'  

Only one more day a-howlin'  
Can't you hear the gals a-callin'  

Only one more day a-rollin'  
Can't you hear the gulls a-callin'  

Only one more day a-furlin'  
Only one more day a-cursin'  

Oh, heave and sight the anchor, Johnny  
For we're close aboard the port, Johnny  

Only one more day for Johnny  
And your pay-day's nearly due, Johnny  

Then put out your long-tail blue, Johnny  
Make your port and take your pay, Johnny  

Only one more day a-pumpin', Johnny  
Only one more day a-bracin'

Oh, we're homeward bound today, Johnny  
We'll leave her without sorrow, Johnny  

Pack your bags today me Johnny  
Oh, an' leave her where she lies, Johnny  

Only one more day a-workin', Johnny  
Oh, come rock 'n' roll me over  

No more gales or heavy weather  
Only one more day together
