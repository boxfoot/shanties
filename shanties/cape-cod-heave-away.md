Cape Cod boys don't got no sleds  
**Heave away, heave away**  
They slide down hills on codfish heads  
**For we're bound for Australia**  

**Heave away me bonny bonny boys**  
**Heave away, heave away**  
**Heave away and don't you make a noise**  
**For we're bound for Australia**  

Cape Cod girls don't got no combsâ€¦  
They comb their hair with codfish bones  

Cape Cod moms don't bake no pies  
They feed their children codfish eyes  

Cape Cod cats don't got no tails  
They lost them all in Cape Cod gales  

Cape Cod dogs don't got no bite  
They lost it barking at the Cape Cod light  

Cape Cod doctors got no pills  
They give their patients codfish gills  

Cape Cod ladies don't give no thrills  
They're plain and skinny as the codfish gills
