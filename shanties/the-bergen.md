Sleep, why'd you wake me with these dreams you bring?  
**Dreams came to me where I lay**  
And deep the melodies the wild waves sing  
**My love is far, far away**  

**Oh, pity the hearts**  
**The wild waves part**  
**My love sails the bonny barque**  
**The Bergen**  

They heap their nets upon the decks by light  
And creep out gentle in the dead of night  

They reap their harvest from the cold night sea  
It leaps with herring 'neath his decks for me  

Steep waves rise above his cold, fair head  
Oh keep him safe to lie here in my bed!  

It weeps with rain tonight where my love lies  
It sweeps the foreign sands from out his eyes
