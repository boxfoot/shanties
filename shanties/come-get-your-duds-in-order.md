title: Come Get Your Duds In Order  
---  
  
Come get your duds in order, for we're going to leave tomorrow  
**Heave away, me jollies, heave away**  
Come get your duds in order, for we're going to cross the water  
**Heave away, me jolly boys, we're all bound away**  
  
Sometimes we're bound for Liverpool; sometimes we're bound for Spain  
Sometimes we're bound for St. Johns Town to watch the girls a-dancing  
  
Now its farewell Maggie darling for its now I'm going to leave you  
You promised me you'd marry me but how you did deceive me  
  
I wrote me love a letter and I signed it with ring  
I wrote me love a letter; I was on the Jenny Lind  
  
Sometimes we're bound for Liverpool, sometimes were bound for Spain  
But now were bound for St. Johns Town to watch the girls a-dancing
