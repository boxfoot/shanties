title: All For Me Grog  
---  
  
**It's all for me grog, me jolly jolly grog**  
**It's all gone for beer and tobacco**  
**Well I spent all me tin on the lassies drinking gin**  
**And across the western ocean I must wander**  
  
Where is me shirt, me noggy noggy shirt? / It's…  
The collar's all worn out and the front is kicked about  
And my tails are looking out for better weather  
  
Where are me boots, me noggy noggy boots?  
They've all gone for beer and tobacco  
The leather's all worn out and the soles are all worn out  
And my toes are looking out for better weather  
  
Where is me bed, me noggy noggy bed? / It's…  
I loant it to a whore and now it's all a-wore  
And the springs are looking out for better weather  
  
Where is me wench, me noggy noggy wench? / She's…  
Her lips is all worn out and her front is kicked about  
And her tail is looking out for better weather  
  
Where is me man, me noggy noggy man? / He's…  
Well he spends all his time with the women and the wine  
So I think that I shall push him over yonder  
  
Where is me whore, me noggy noggy whore? / She's…  
It's her I want to lay, but she says I cannot pay  
So my whore is looking out for richer sailors  
  
  
**It's all for me grog, me jolly jolly grog**  
It's all gone for beer and tobacco  
Well I spent all me loot in a house of ill repute  
And I think that I shall go back there tomorrow  
  
Well I'm sick in the head, and I haven't been to bed,  
Since first I came ashore with me plunder,  
I've seen centipedes and snakes, and I'm full of pains and aches,  
And I think that I shall push out over yonder  
  
Well me money was a-spent, and so off to see we went,  
And the ocean looked like whiskey, 'twas an omen,  
Well we set off for Cathay, but we washed up far away,  
On the bonnie, bonnie banks of Loch Lomond
