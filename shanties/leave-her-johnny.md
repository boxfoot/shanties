title: Leave Her, Johnny, Leave Her
---

Oh the times are hard and the wages low  
**Leave her, Johnny, leave her**  
But now once more ashore we'll go  
**And it's time for us to leave her**  

**Leave her, Johnny, leave her**  
**Oh leave her, Johnny, leave her**  
**For the voyage is done and the winds don't blow**  
**And it's time for us to leave her**  

The winds were foul and the work was hard...  
From the Liverpool dock to the London yard...  

There was rotten meat and weev'ly bread  
You'd eat it or you'd starve to death  

I hate to sail on this rotten tub  
No grog allowed and rotten grub  

The skipper was bad but the mate was worse  
He'd blow you down with a spike and a curse  

Oh the winds were hard and the water high  
She shipped it green and none went by  

The sails are furled and the anchor is stowed  
And no more around Cape Horn we'll go  

I thought I heard the old man say  
You can go ashore and spend your pay  

The rats have left, and we the crew  
It's time, by Christ, that we did, too  

We'll make her fast and stow our gear  
The gals are a-waiting on the pier  

Oh if ye can leave her like a man  
Then leave her, Johnny, while ye can
