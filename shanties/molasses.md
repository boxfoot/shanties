Oh, the African man cuts the sugar cane  
**Oh, molasses**  
He works in the sun and he works in the rain  
**Oh, molasses rum**  
Then he loads it up on a wooden ship and he sends it off on a northern trip  
**Singing, oh molasses, oh molasses rum**  

**Oh, molasses**  
**Old New England tea**  
**It killed my grandpa, killed my pa**  
**And it sure as Hell is killing me**  
**Singing, oh molasses, oh molasses rum**  

When they fought the war for the colonies…  
They fought it over New England tea…  
When Old King George put a tax on it the colonies nearly took a fit  
**Singing, oh molasses, oh molasses rum**  

In the time of the 1917 war  
Molasses sitting on the Boston shore  
When they pumped it in it was twelve degrees,  
a long cold night in a Boston freeze  
**Singing, oh molasses, oh molasses rum** 

_(no chorus here)_  
In the morning it was 42  
Molasses vat split clean in two  
Two million gallons covered the bay,  
26 people drowned in the flood that day  
**Singing, oh molasses, oh molasses rum**  

My grandpa he died cutting cane  
My pa went down in the great brown rain  
But I won't go in a pool of blood; no I won't drown in a black-strap flood  
**Still, I'll go down to molasses, oh molasses rum**
