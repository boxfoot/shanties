title: Haul Away Joe  
---  
  
When I was a little boy my mother always told me  
**Way, haul away, we'll haul away Joe**  
That if I did not kiss the girls (boys) my lips would grow all moldy  
**Way, haul away, we'll haul away Joe**  
  
Once in my life I married a wife but she was fat and lazy...  
Then I met an Irish girl, she damn near drove me crazy...  
  
**Way, haul away, we're bound for better weather**  
**Way, haul away, we'll haul away Joe**  
  
Once I was in Ireland, a-digging turf and taters  
But now I'm on a Limey (pirate) ship, a-hauling on the braces  
  
St. Patrick drove away the snakes, then drank up all the whiskey  
This made him sing and dance a jig, he felt so fine and frisky  
  
**Way, haul away, we're bound for better weather**  
**Way, haul away, we'll haul away Joe**  
  
You call yourself a second mate but you can't tie a bowline  
You cannot even stand up straight when the ship is a-rolling  
  
The cook is in the galley making duff so handy  
The captain's in his cabin (boy) drinking wine and brandy  
  
**Way, haul away, the good ship is a-rolling**  
**Way, haul away, we'll haul away Joe**
