**One for the _Morning Glory_**  
**Two for the sweet brown brew**  
**Three for the man who'll stand his round**  
**And four for the love of you, me girls**  
**Four for the love of you**  

At the end of the day I like a couple drinks when I raise up my voice and sing  
An hour or two with the fine brown brew and I'm ready for anything  
At the Cross Keys Inn there were sisters four, the landlord's daughters fair  
And every night when they turned out the light they'd invite me up the stairs  

I got the call from foreign shores to go and fight the foe  
And I thought no more of the sisters four though they cried to see me go  
I sailed away on a ship, the _Morning Glory_ was her name  
We'd all fall down when the rum went round, then get up and drink again  

I bore once more to my native shore, farewell to the raging main  
The Cross Keys Inn, it was beckoning, with the rum to ease my pain  
But there on the shore were the sisters four with a bundle upon each knee  
There were three little girls and a bastard boy and they all looked just like me
