  - Home Dearie Home

O Amble is a fine town with ships about the bay  
It's fain and very fain to be there myself today  
I'm wishing in my heart I was far away from here  
Sitting in my parlor and talking with my dear  

**And it's home, dearie, home, it's home I want to be**  
**My topsails are hoisted and I am out to sea**  
**The oak and the ash and the bonnie birchen tree**  
**Are all a-growing green in the North country**  
**And it's home, dearie, home**  

A letter came today, but somehow I cannot speak  
And the proud and happy tears are a-rolling down my checks  
There's someone here, she says, you've been waiting for to see  
With your merry hazel eyes, looking up from off my knee  

But the letter never said if we have a boy or girl  
Got me so confused that my heart is all a whirl  
So I'm going back to port, where I'll quickly turn around  
And take the fastest ship, which to Ambletown is bound  

Well, if it be a girl, she shall wear a golden ring  
If it be a boy, he shall live to serve the King  
With his buckles and his boot and his little jacket blue  
He'll walk the quarterdeck, like his daddy used to do
