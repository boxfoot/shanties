A soldier and a sailor were out walking one day  
Said the soldier to the sailor, "I shall teach you to pray  
Weâ€™ll pray for the welfare of all women and all men  
And whatever I shall pray for, you must answer 'Amen'"  
**And whatever I shall pray for**  
**And whatever I shall pray for**  
**And whatever I shall pray for, you must answer 'Amen'**  

"Now the first thing we shall pray for, let us pray for some cash  
Oh glory, glory, we will go on a bash  
And if we have one pound, may we also have ten  
**May we have the Bank of England," said the sailor, "Amen"**  

"Now what shall we pray for, let's pray for some beer,  
Oh glory, glory, that will give us good cheer  
And if we have one pint, may we also have ten  
**May we have a bloody brewery, said the sailor, "Amen"**  

"Now the next thing we'll pray for, let us pray for the Queen  
And may she live as happy and long may she reign  
And if she has one child, may she also have ten  
**May she have a bonny orchestra," said the sailor, "Amen"**

"Now the last thing we pray for, let's pray for our peace  
From Cape Town to Belfast, from Glasgow to Greece  
And if we have one year, may we also have ten --  
**May there never be another war", said the sailor, "Amen"**
