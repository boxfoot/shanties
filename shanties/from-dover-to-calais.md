title: From Dover to Calais
aka:
 - Blow Hard and Hover
---

I thought I heard the old man cry  
**Blow hard and hover!**  
"Rev up the fans; it's time to fly"  
**From Dover to Calais.**

I thought I heard the first mate quip  
"Is this an airplane or a ship?"

I thought I heard a Belgian say  
"Your shopping bags are full today"

I thought I heard a Frenchman answer  
"It's all so cheap at Marks and Spencer"

I thought I heard an old ghost scream  
"You'll go the way of sail and steam"

I signed on board at seventeen  
I had no sea legs; I was green

I worked these craft from stern to bow  
It's thirty years I've known them now

In sixty-eight no ships were newer  
I thought my future was secure

Where will I go, what will I do  
Now that they've pushed the tunnel through
