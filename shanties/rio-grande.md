Oh say were you ever in Rio Grande?  
**Oh, you Rio!**  
It's there that the river runs down golden sand  
**And we're bound for the Rio Grande**  

**Then away, love, away**  
**Oh! You Rio!**  
**Sing fare-ye-well to my pretty young girl**  
**And we're bound for the Rio Grande**  

This old New York town is no place for me  
I'll pack up my sea-chest and get off to sea  

Now all you beach comers we'll have you to know  
We're bound for the south'ard and glad for to go  

So it's put down your bag and get it unpacked  
The sooner we leave here the quicker we're back  

There's some of us sick and there's some of us sore  
We've scoffed all our whack and we're looking for more  

Our ship went sailing out over the bar  
We pointed her nose towards the southern star  

Them Liverpool judies they never use combs  
They comb out their locks with a haddock's backbone  

It's goodbye to Ellen and sweet Molly too  
Ye Parkee Lane chowlahs 'tis goodbye to you  

Cheer up Mary Ellen an' don't look so glum  
On white stockin' day ye'll be drinkin' hot rum  

We've a bully good ship with a bully good crew  
But we don't like the grub, no I'm damned if we do  

The anchor is weighed and our sails are all set  
The girls that we're leaving we'll never forget
