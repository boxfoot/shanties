title: Blow Ye Winds In The Morning  
---  
  
'Tis advertised in Boston, New York and Buffalo  
Five hundred brave Americans, A-whaling for to go, singing  
**Blow, ye winds in the morning, blow, ye winds, high-ho!**  
**Clear away your running gear, and blow, boys, blow!**

They send you to New Bedord, that famous whaling port,  
And give you to some land-sharks to board and fit you out.  

They send you to a boarding-house, there for a time to dwell;  
The thieves they there are thicker than the other side of hell!  

It's now we're out to sea, my boys, the wind comes on to blow;  
One half the watch is sick on deck, the other half below.  

The cooper's at the vise-bench, a-making iron poles,  
And the mate's upon the main hatch a-cursing all our souls.  

The Skipper's on the quarter-deck a-squinting at the sails,  
When up aloft the lookout sights a mighty school of whales.  

Now we have got him turned up, we tow him alongside;  
We over with our blubber-hooks and rob him of his hide.  

But now that our old ship is full and we don't give a damn,  
We'll bend on all our stu'nsails and sail for Yankee land.  

When we get home, our ship made fast, and we get through our sailing,  
A winding glass around we'll pass and damn this blubber whaling!
