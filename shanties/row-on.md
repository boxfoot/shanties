title: Row On  
---  
  
Clouds are upon the summer sky  
There's thunder in the wind  
Pull on, pull on, and homeward hie  
Nor give one look behind  

**Row on, row on, another day**  
**May shine with brighter light**  
**Ply, ply the oars and pull away**  
**There's dawn beyond the night**  

Bear where thou goest the words of love  
Say all that words can say  
Changeless affection, strength to prove  
But speed upon the way  

Like yonder river would I glide  
To where my heart would be  
My barque should soon out-sail the tide  
That hurries to the sea  

But yet a star shines constant still  
Through yonder cloudy sky  
And hope as bright my bosom fills  
From faith that cannot die  

Row on, row on, God speed the way  
Thou must not linger here  
Storms hang about the closing day  
Tomorrow may be clear
