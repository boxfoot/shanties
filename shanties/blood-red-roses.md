title: Blood Red Roses  
---  
  
Our boots and shoes are all in pawn  
**Go down, you blood red roses, go down**  
It's flaming drafty 'round Cape Horn  
**Go down, you blood red roses, go down**  

**Ah, you pinks and posies**  
**Go down, you blood red roses, go down**  

It's 'round Cape Horn with frozen sail…  
Around Cape Stiff to hunt for whale…  

It's 'round Cape Horn the ship must go  
For that is where them whalefishes blow  

It's growl you may but go you must  
You growl too hard your head they'll bust  

The topman at the mate he roars  
"It's lay aloft, you lazy whores!"  

Rock and shake her is the cry  
The bleeding topmast sheave is dry  

Just one more pull and that will do  
For we're the boys to kick her through
