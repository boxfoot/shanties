title: The Ballad Of Captain Kidd  
---  
  
My name is Captain Kidd **as I sailed, as I sailed**  
**My name is Captain Kidd as I sailed.**  
**My name is Captain Kidd**, and wickedly I did  
And wickedly I did **as I sailed, as I sailed**  
**And wickedly I did as I sailed.**  

**My parents taught me well as I sailed, as I sailed**  
My parents taught me well to shun the gates of Hell  
But against them I rebelled **as I sailed**

I'd a Bible in my hand…  
**I'd a Bible in my hand;** I sunk it in the sand  

Before I left the strand…  
I spied three ships of Spain…  
**I spied**  **three**  **ships of Spain** ; I fired on them the main  

'Til all three crew was slain…  
I'd eighty bars of gold…  
**I'd eighty bars of gold** and dollars in the hold  
And riches uncontrolled…  

I murdered William Moore…  
**I murdered William Moore** and left him in his gore  
Full forty leagues from shore…  
O'ertaken now at last…  
**O'ertaken now at last** and into prison cast  

And sentence being passed…  
To execution dock **I must go, I must go**  
**To execution dock I must go**  
**To execution dock** while thousands 'round me flock  

To see me on the block **as I go, as I go**  
**To see me on the block as I go**.  
**They called me**  **Captain Kidd**  **as I sailed, as I sailed.**  
**They called me Captain Kidd**** , and wickedly I did**  
**And wickedly I did**  **as I sailed, as I sailed.**
