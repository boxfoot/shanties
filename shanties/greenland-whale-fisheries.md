They took us jolly sailor lads  
A-fishing for the whale  
In the year of our lord eighteen hundred and six  
Bound for Greenland we set sail, **brave boys**  
**Bound for Greenland we set sail**
  
The lookout stood on the crosstrees high  
With a spyglass in his hand  
There's a whale, there's a whale, there's a whalefish, he cried  
And she blows at every span, **brave boys**  
**And she blows at every span**
  
The Captain stood on the quarter deck  
And a sod of a man was he  
Overhaul, overhaul, let your davit tackles fall  
And we'll launch them boats to sea, **brave boys**  
**And we'll launch them boats to sea**
  
We stuck that whale and the line played out  
But she gave a flurry with her tail  
And the boat capsized, we lost seven of our men  
And we never caught that whale, **brave boys**  
**And we never caught that whale**
  
Now the losing of seven fine seamen  
Oh it grieved our captain sore  
But the losing of that bloody sperm whale  
Oh it grieved him ten times more, **brave boys**  
**Oh it grieved him ten times more**
  
Now Greenland is a horrid place  
Where us fisher-lads have to go  
Where the rose and the lily never bloom in Spring  
And there's only ice and snow, **brave boys**  
**And there's only ice and snow**
