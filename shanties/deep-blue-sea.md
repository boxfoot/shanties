title: Deep Blue Sea
---

Deep blue sea, baby, deep blue sea (3x)  
**It was Willy what got drowned in the deep blue sea**

Dig his grave with a silver spade  
**It was Willy what got drowned in the Deep Blue Sea**

Lower him down with a golden chain  
**It was Willy what got drowned in the deep blue sea**

Wrap him up with a silken shroud  
**It was Willy what got drowned in the deep blue sea**

Golden sun bring him back to me  
**It was Willy what got drowned in the deep blue sea**

Deep blue sea, baby, deep blue sea  
**It was Willy what got drowned in the deep blue sea**
