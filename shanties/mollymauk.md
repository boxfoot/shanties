title: Mollymauk
---

Down the southern ocean is a lonely place  
The storms are many and the shelter's scarce  
**Down upon the southern ocean sailing**  
**Down below Cape Horn**  
Over traveled waters and the restless skies  
You'll see those mollymauks rise and dive  
**Down upon the southern ocean sailing**  
**Down below Cape Horn**

**Why don't you ride the wind and go white seabird**  
**Ride the wind and go mollymauk**  
**Down upon the southern ocean sailing**  
**Down below Cape Horn**

Now the mollymauk lies on his great white wings  
Lord, what a lonesome song he sings  
He's got no compass and he's got no gear  
Nobody knows where the mollymauk steers

He's the ghost of a sailor so I've heard said  
His body 'came sand and his soul flew away  
He's got no haven and he's got no home  
Bound evermore to wheel and roam

When I gets too old and I sail no more  
Set me adrift far away from shore  
You can cast me loose you can set me free  
I'll keep that big bird company
