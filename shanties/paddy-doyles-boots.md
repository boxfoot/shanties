**To me way, ay, ay, ay, ay, ah!**  
We'll pay Paddy Doyle for his boots  

**To me way, ay, ay, ay, ay, ah!**  
We'll all throw mud at the cook  

**To me way, ay, ay, ay, ay, ah!**  
That dirty old man on the poop  

**To me way, ay, ay, ay, ay, ah!**  
We'll all drink whiskey and gin  

**To me way, ay, ay, ay, ay, ah!**  
We'll all shave under our chin  

**To me way, ay, ay, ay, ay, ah!**  
We'll pay Paddy Doyle for his boots
