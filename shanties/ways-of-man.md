title: The Ways Of Man  
---  
  
The ways of man are passing strange  
He buys his freedom and he counts his change  
Then he lets the wind his days arrange  
And he calls the tide his master  

**Oh the days, oh the days**  
**Oh the fine long summer days**  
**The fish come rolling in the bays**  
**And he swore he'd never leave me**  

But the days grow short and the year gets old  
And the fish won't stay where the water's cold  
And if they're going to fill the hold  
They've got to go offshore to find them  

So they go outside on the raving deep  
And they pray the Lord their soul to keep  
But the waves will roll them all to sleep  
And the tide will be their keeper  

**Oh the tide, oh the tide**  
**Oh you dark and you bitter tide**  
**If I can't have him by my side**  
**I guess I have to leave him**  

I gave you one, I gave you two  
The best that rotten old boat could do  
You wouldn't be happy till I gave you three  
But I'll be damned if you'll get me  

**Oh the tide, oh the tide,**  
**Oh you dark and you bitter tide**  
**If I can't have him by my side**  
**The water's welcome to him**  

Oh Lord I know that the day will come  
When one less boat comes slogging home  
I don't mind knowing that he'll be the one  
But I can't spend my whole life praying  

I gave you one, I gave you two  
The best that poor old boat could do  
You'd have it all before you're through  
Well I've got no more to give you
