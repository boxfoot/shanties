My father often told me when I was just a lad  
A sailor's life is very hard, the food is always bad  
But now I've joined the Navy, I'm on board a man-o'-war  
And now I find a sailor ain't a sailor anymore  

**Don't haul on the rope, don't climb up the mast**  
**If you see a sailing ship it might be your last**  
**Just get your civvies ready for another run ashore**  
**A sailor ain't a sailor ain't a sailor anymore**  

The killick of our mess he says we've had it soft  
It wasn't like this in his day when he was up aloft  
We like our bunks and sleeping bags, but what's a hammock for?  
Swinging from the deckhead or lying on the floor?  

They gave us an engine that first went up and down  
Then with more technology the engine went around  
We're good with steam and diesel, but what's a mainyard for?  
A stoker ain't a stoker with a shovel anymore  

They gave us an Aldis Lamp so we can do it right  
They gave us a radio, we signal day and night  
We know our codes and ciphers, but what's a "sema" for?  
A bunting-tosser doesn't toss the bunting anymore  

They gave us a radar set to pierce the fog and gloom  
Now the lookout's sitting in a tiny darkened room  
Loran does navigation, the sonar says how deep  
The Jimmy's three sheets to the wind, the skipper's fast asleep  

Two cans of beer a day, that's your bleeding lot  
But now we gets an extra one because they stopped the Tot  
So, we'll put on our civvy-clothes and find a pub ashore  
A sailor's still a sailor, just like he was before
