**Wasn't that a mighty storm? Yeah**  
**Wasn't that a mighty storm in the morning?**  
**Wasn't that a mighty storm?**  
**Blew all the people away**  

Galveston had a sea wall  
Meant to keep the water down  
High tide from the ocean  
Sent water all over town

Well, now the year was 1900  
Fifty long years ago  
Death came walking on the water  
Death calls, you gotta go

The trumpets sounded warning  
Said it's time to leave this place  
But no one thought about leaving town  
Till death stared them in the face  

Then the sea started boiling  
A thing that no ship could withstand  
Think I heard a sea captain cryin' out  
Somebody save a drownin' man

Had two trains loaded  
People trying to leave the town  
Tracks gave way to the water now  
All of those people drowned

I said way back in 1900  
Fifty long years ago  
Death came walking on the water  
Death calls, you gotta go

I said, death, your hands are clammy  
You got them on the knee  
You came and put a stone on my mother, oh  
Coming after me
