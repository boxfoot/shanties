title: Fiddler's Green

**Dress me up in me oilskins and jumper**  
**No more on the docks I'll be seen**  
**Just tell me old shipmates I'm taking a trip, mates**  
**And I'll see you someday on Fiddler's Green**  

Oh, Fiddler's Green is a place I've heard tell  
Where fishermen go if they don't go to Hell  
Where the weather is fair and the dolphins do play  
And the cold coast of Greenland is far far away  

Where the sky's always blue and there's never a gale  
Where the fish jump on board with a swish of their tails  
Where you lie at your leisure, there's no work to do  
And the skipper's below making tea for the crew  

When you get back to dock and your long trip is through  
There's pubs, and there's clubs, and there's lassies there, too  
The girls are all pretty and the beer is all free  
And there's bottles of rum growing on every tree  

Well I don't want a harp nor a halo, not me  
Just give me a breeze and a good rolling sea  
And I'll play me old squeezebox as we sail along  
With the wind in the rigging to sing me this song
