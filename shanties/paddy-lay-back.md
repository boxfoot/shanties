'Twas a cold a dreary morning in December _(December)_  
An' all of me money it was spent _(spent spent)_  
Where it went to, Lord I can't remember _(remember)_  
So down to the shipping office I went _(went went)_  

**Paddy lay back** _(Paddy lay back!)_  
**Take in the slack** _(Take in the slack!)_  
**Take a turn around the capstan heave a pawl** _(Heave a pawl!)_  
**About ship's stations, boys, be handy** _(Be handy!)_  
**For we're bound for Valipariso 'round the Horn**  

That day there was a great demand for sailors  
For the colonies, for 'Frisco and for France  
So I shipped aboard a limey barque _The Hotspur_  
And got paralytic drunk on my advance  

I woke up in the morning sick and sore-o  
And I knew that I was outward bound again  
When I heard a voice a-bawling at the door-o  
"Lay aloft ye sods and answer to your names!"  

'Twas on the quarter deck where first I saw 'em  
Such an ugly bunch I never seen before  
For there was a bum and stiff from every quarter  
And it made me poor old heart feel sick and sore  

There was Spaniards and Dutchmen and Rooshians  
And Johnny Crappos just across from France _(Vive La France!)_  
And most of 'em couldn't speak a word of English  
But they answered to the name of "Month's Advance"  

I asked the mate a-which a-watch was mine-o  
Says he "I'll soon pick out a-which is which"  
And he blowed me down and kicked me hard astern-o  
Calling me a lousy dirty son-of-a-bitch  

So there I was a-once more out to sea boys  
The same ol' bloody business o'er again  
Oh, stamp the capstan 'round and make some noise, boys  
And sing again this dear ol' sweet refrain
