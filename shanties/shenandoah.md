Oh Shenandoah, I long to see you  
**Away, you rolling river**  
Oh Shenandoah, I long to see you  
**Away, we're bound away, 'cross the wide Missour-ai**  

Oh Shenandoah, I took a notion…  
To sail across the stormy ocean…  

Oh Shenandoah, I'm bound to leave you  
But Shenandoah, I'll not deceive you  

Oh Shenandoah, I love your daughters  
I love the music of your waters  

'Tis seven long years since last I see'd you  
But Shenandoah, I'll never grieve you  

Oh Shenandoah, I long to see you  
Oh Shenandoah, I long to see you
