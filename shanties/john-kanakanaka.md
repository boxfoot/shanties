I thought I heard the Old Man say  
**John Kanakanaka too-ri-ay**  
Today today is a holiday  
**John Kanakanaka too-ri-ay**  

**Too-ri-ay, oh too-ri-ay**  
**John Kanakanaka too-ri-ay**  

I thought I heard the boatswain say…  
There's work tomorrow but no work today…  

The boatswain says "Before I'm through  
You'll curse your mother for having you"

There's rotten meat and weev'ly bread  
Just like the Gate the Old Man said  

She would not steer and she would not stay  
She shipped the water both night and day  

We're all Liverpool born and bred  
Strong in the arm but thick in the head  

Growl ye may but go you must  
If you growl too loud your head they'll bust  

Around Cape Horn our ship must go  
Around Cape Horn through the ice and snow  

My dear old mum she wrote to me  
Oh son, my son come home from sea  

It's one more pull and that will do  
And we're the bullies to pull her through
