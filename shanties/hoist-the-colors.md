title: Hoist The Colours  
---  
  
The king and his men stole the queen from her bed  
And bound her in her bones  
The seas be ours and by the powers  
Where we will we'll roam  

**Yo, ho, all hands**  
**Hoist the colours high**  
**Heave ho, thieves and beggars**  
**Never shall we die**  

Some men have died and some are alive  
And others sail on the sea  
With the keys to the cage and the Devil to pay  
We lay to Fiddler's Green  

The bell has been raised from its watery grave  
Do you hear its sepulchral tone?  
We're a call to all, pay heed the squall  
And turn your sails toward home!
