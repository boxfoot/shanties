aka:  
  - Oh, Dear Ale

It's of dear grog to you I'll sing,  
And to dear grog I'll always cling,  
I like my cup filled to the brim,  
And I'll drink all you'd like to bring.  
  
**And it's oh, dear grog, thou art my darling,**  
**And my joy both night and morning.**  
  
If all the rest of Adam's race  
Was assembled in this place,  
I'd part with all without one tear  
Before I'd part with you, my dear  
  
The brewer brewed thee in his pan,  
The tapster drew thee in his can,  
Now I with thee will play my part,  
And lodge thee ever near my heart  
  
And if my wife should me despise,  
By Jove, I'd pluck out both her eyes,  
But if she loved me as I love thee,  
A happy couple we would be  
  
Though oft hast made my friends my foes,  
And oft hast made me pawn my clothes,  
But since thou art so near my nose,  
It's up, me boys, and down she goes  
  
Now since this liquor's all drunk up,  
Methinks to you I'll hand this cup,  
And when you've filled it up with sling,  
I'll drink your health all 'round again
