'Twas on the long stone lighthouse there dwelt an English maid  
Pure as the air around her, of danger ne'er afraid  
One morning just at daybreak, a storm tossed wreck she spied  
And up spake brave Grace Darling: "I'll save the crew," she cried  

**So she pulled away on the rolling sea**  
**Over the waters blue**  
**"Help! Help!" she could hear the cry of the shipwrecked crew**  
**But Grace had an English heart**  
**and the raging storm she braved**  
**She pulled away o'er the rolling sea and the crew she saved**

They to the rock were clinging  
a crew of nine all told.  
Between them and the lighthouse  
the seas like mountains rose.  
Said Grace "Come help me, father,"  
"We'll launch the boat," said she  
Her father cried "'Tis madness,  
To face that raging sea"

One murmured prayer "heaven guard us"  
And then they were afloat  
Between them and destruction  
The planks of that frail boat.  
Then spoke the maiden's father  
"Return or doomed are we"  
But up spoke brave Grace Darling  
"Alone I'll brave the sea"

They bravely rode the billows  
And reached the rock at length  
They saved the storm tossed sailors  
In heaven alone their strength  
Oh tell the wide world over  
What English pluck can do  
And sing of brave Grace Darling  
Who nobly saved the crew
