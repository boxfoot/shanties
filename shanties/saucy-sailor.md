title: Saucy Sailor  
---  
  
Come me own one, come me fair one  
Come now unto me  
Could ye fancy a poor sailor lad  
Who has just come from the sea?  
Oh you're ragged, love, and you're dirty, love  
And your clothes smell much of tar  
So be gone you saucy sailor lad  
So be gone you Jack Tar  
If I'm ragged, love, and I'm dirty, love  
And me clothes smell much of tar  
I have silver in me pocket, love  
And gold in great store  
And then when she heard him say so  
On her bended knees she fell:  
I will marry my dear Henry,  
For I love the sailor lads so well!  
Do you think that I, I am foolish love?  
Do you think that I am mad?  
For to wed with a poor country girl  
Where no fortune's to be had?  
I will cross the briny ocean,  
I will whistle and sing  
And since you've refused the offer, love,  
Some other girl shall wear the ring  
I am frolicsome, and I am easy,  
Good-tempered and free  
And I don't give a single pin, me boys,  
What the world thinks of me
