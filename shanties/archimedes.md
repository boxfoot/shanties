_missing first verse_

**The lever, boys, the lever,**  
**Oh the lever, boys, the lever,**  
**Not the pulley or the screw or the inclined plane,**  
**It's time to use the lever!**  

Now the inclined plane, it will launch our ship,  
And the screw, it may well sink her,  
And the pulleys we pull in the rigging all day,  
But what about the lever?  

When the grog it is brought up on deck,  
Our thirst, it's a reliever,  
And the bung won't leave the bunghole,  
Then it's time to use the lever!  

Archimedes, he is dead and gone,  
May God be his receiver.  
Then we'll dig his grave with a silver spade,  
Which, in fact, is just a lever!
