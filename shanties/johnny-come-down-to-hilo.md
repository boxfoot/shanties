title: Johnny Come Down To Hilo  
---  
  
Never seen the like since I been born  
An Arkansas farmer with his sea boots on  
**Johnny come down to Hilo, poor old man**  

**Wake her, shake her**  
**Wake that gal with the blue dress on**  
**Johnny come down to Hilo, poor old man**  

I got a gal across the sea  
She's a 'Badian beauty and she says to meâ€¦  

Sally's in the garden picking peas  
The hair on her head hanging down to her knees  

My wife she died in Tennessee  
And they sent her jawbone back to me  

I put that jawbone on the fence  
And I ain't heard nothing but the jawbone since  

So hand me down my riding cane  
I'm off to see Ms. Sarah Jane
