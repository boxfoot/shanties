Farewell and adieu to you, Spanish Ladies,  
Farewell and adieu to you, ladies of Spain  
For we've received orders for to sail for old England  
But we hope in short time for to see you again  

**We will rant and we'll roar like true British sailors,**  
**We'll rant and we'll roar all on the salt seas**  
**Until we strike soundings in the channel of old England**  
**From Ushant to Scilly is thirty-five leagues**  

We hove our ship to with the wind from sou'west, boys  
We hove our ship to, deep soundings to take  
'Twas forty-five fathoms, with a white sandy bottom,  
So we squared our main yard and up channel did make  

The first land we sighted was call-ed the Dodman,  
Next Rame Head off Plymouth, Start, Portland and Wight  
We sailed by Beachy, by Fairlight and Dover  
And then we bore up for the South Foreland light  

Then the signal was made for the grand fleet to anchor,  
And all in the Downs that night for to lie  
Let go your shank painter, let go your cat stopper  
Haul up your clewgarnets, let tacks and sheets fly!  

Now let ev'ry man drink off his full bumper,  
And let ev'ry man drink off his full glass  
We'll drink and be jolly and drown melancholy,  
And here's to the health of each true-hearted lass.
