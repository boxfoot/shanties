Windsor is a lovely port we're proud to sing about  
There's a warehouse full of whisky, though the Yankees do without  
And when Customs asks us where we're bound, we ship our oars and shout:  
"We're bound for Valparaiso in a rowboat"
 
**Pull your oars! We're on our way!**  
**With a thousand quarts of whisky bound for Valparaiso Bay**  
**And we haven't no intention for to see the U. S. A.**  
**We're bound for Valparaiso in a rowboat**
 
Some say that for an ocean trip our craft is very small  
But we bold Canadian lads don't fear a little Cape Horn squall  
And a deep sea schooner's just too big to shoot Niagara Falls  
We're bound for Valparaiso in a rowboat
 
We've sailed for Valparaiso twenty seven times this week  
But every time we've gotten to the mouth of Muddy Creek  
We've had to jettison our cargo 'cause the oarlock sprung a leak  
We're bound for Valparaiso in a rowboat
 
Now some sing of Vancouver, of St John and Halifax  
But those salty water cities, they have nothing Windsor lacks  
We've a doryload of whisky and the muscles in our backs  
We're bound for Valparaiso in a rowboat
