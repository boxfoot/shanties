title: A-Rovin'  
---  
  
In Amsterdam there lived a maid  
**Mark well what I do say**  
In Amsterdam there lived a maid  
And she was mistress of her trade  
**I'll go no more a-rovin' with you, fair maid**  
**A-rovin', a-rovin', since rovin's been my ru-i-n**  
**I'll go no more a-rovin' with you, fair maid**  
Her lips were red her eyes were brown…  
Her hair was black and hanging down…  
These last ten months I'd been to sea  
And Hell, this gal looked good to me  
I took this maid out for a walk  
And we had such a lovely talk  
I took her hand within my own  
Said she, "It's time that I was home"  
I put my hand upon her knee  
Said she, "Young man, you're rather free"  
I put my hand around her waist  
Said she, "Young man, you're in great haste"  
I put my hand upon her thigh  
Said she, "Young man, you're rather high"  
I put my hand upon her breast  
We did the dance she does the best  
But when me money all was spent  
'Twas off to sea I gladly went

title: Auld Triangle  
---  
  
A hungry feeling came o'er me stealing  
And the mice were squealing in my prison cell  
**And the old triangle went jingle jangle**  
**All along the banks of the royal canal**  
To begin the morning the screw was bawling  
"Get up, ya bowsie, and clean up your cell"  
The screw was peeping, Humpy Gussy was sleeping  
As I lay there dreaming of my girl, Sal  
Up in the female prison there are seventy-five women  
And 'tis among them I wish I did dwell

title: The Ball Of Kerrymuir  
---  
  
Four and twenty virgins came down from Inverness  
And when the ball was over there were four and twenty less!  
**Singing balls to your partner; your ass against the wall**  
**If you've never been had on a Saturday night, you've never been had at all.**  
There was doin' in the parlor, and doin' on the stones  
You couldn't hear the music for the wheezin' and the moans  
The village cripple he was there, but he could not do much  
So he lined the ladies against the wall and did 'em with his crutch  
The village economist he was there, his prick held in his hand  
Waitin' for the moment when supply would meet demand  
The village postman he was there, but the poor man had the pox  
He couldn't do the lassies, so he did the letter box  
Anne Boleyn was also there, even though she's dead  
She's terrific on her back, me boys, but better giving head!  
Pinocchio was also there, and quite a sight to see  
The ladies sat upon his face and shouted, "Lie to me!"  
The village magician, he was there; he gave us all a laugh  
He pulled his foreskin over his head and vanished up his ass!

title: Baltimore Whores  
---  
  
There were four old whores from Baltimore  
Drinking beer and wine.  
The topic of conversation was  
"Yours is smaller than mine."  
**Roly, poly, tickle my hole-y,**  
**Smell of my slimy slough.**  
**Then drag your nuts across my guts,**  
**I'm one of the whorey crew.**  
The first old whore from Baltimore said,  
"Mine's as big as the air.  
The birds fly in, the birds fly out,  
And never touch a hair."  
The second old whore from Baltimore said,  
"Mine's as big as the moon.  
The men jump in, the men jump out,  
And never touch the womb."  
The third old whore from Baltimore said,  
"Mine's as big as the sea.  
The ships sail in, the ships sail out,  
And leave their rigging free."  
The fourth old whore from Baltimore said,  
"Mine's the biggest of all.  
A man went up in the springtime,  
And didn't come out till fall."

As I was walking down the strand  
 Hoo dah, hoo dah.  
 I spied two bitches hand in hand.  
 Oh, hoo dah day.  
**Blow, boys, blow, for Californi-o.  
 There's plenty of grass to wipe your ass  
 On the banks of the Sacramento.**  
I chose the one with the curly locks;  
 Hoo dah, hoo dah  
 She's the bugger that gave me the pox.  
 Oh, hoo dah day  
 So off to the doctor I did go  
 Prick and balls I had to show.  
 In come the doctor with a bloody big lance  
 Said, "Now, young sailor, I'll make ye dance."  
 In come the nurse with a mustard poultice  
 She jammed it on, but I took no notice.  
 Now I'm well and free from pain  
 If I meet that whore I'll fuck her again.

## By Splinter-Eye  
**Blackthorn, carry me home,**  
**For it's down the hedgerows I will travel.**  
**Blackened skin and poison thorns,**  
**Blackthorn, carry me home.**  
**Oh, blackthorn, carry me home.**  
I went on the back roads and there did see  
There did see a rosary,  
A poor old mother on her hands and knees.  
Blackthorn, carry me home.  
She wept on the ground where the bright sun shone.  
The bright sun shone, on and on.  
"I had three children, they are dead and gone."  
Blackthorn, carry me home.  
I cut a branch of the poison thorns,  
Poison thorns like the devil's horns,  
A staff for to carry me 'til the morn.  
Blackthorn, carry me home.

title: Blow The Man Down  
---  
  
As I was a-walkin' down Paradise Street  
_(To me!)_ **Way, hey, blow the man down**  
A pretty young damsel I chanced for to meet  
**Give me some time to blow the man down**  
She was round in the corner and bluff in the bow…  
So I took in all sail and cried "Way enough now"…  
I threw out my hawser and took her in tow  
And yardarm to yardarm away did we go  
She said to me "Sir, will you stand for the treat?"  
"Delighted," says I, "for a charmer so sweet"  
It was up in her quarters she piped me aboard  
And there on her bed I cut loose with my sword  
But just as my cutter was forging ahead  
She shouted "My husband!" and jumped out of bed  
He was seven feet tall, had a chest like a horse  
And right for my jawbone he plotted his course  
He loosened my rigging, he kicked me in stays  
I flew down the stairs like a ship on the way  
I chanced on a packet that happened on by  
And when I awoke I was bound for Shanghai  
So I'll give you fair warning before we belay  
Don't ever take heed of what pretty girls say

Now what are the joys of a single young man?  
**Why, boozing, bloody well boozing**  
And what is he doing whenever he can?  
**Why, boozing, bloody well boozing**  
You may think I'm wrong or you may think I'm right  
I'm not going to argue, I know you can't fight  
But what do you think we are doing tonight?  
**Why, boozing, bloody well boozing**  
**Boozing, boozing, just you and I**  
**Boozing, boozing, when we are dry**  
**Some do it openly, some on the sly**  
**And we all are bloody well boozing**  
Oh what are the joys of a poor married man? **…**  
And what is he doing whenever he can? **…**  
He comes home at night and he gives his wife all  
He goes out a-shopping, makes many a call  
But what brings him home hanging on to the wall? **…**  
And what do the moral majority run down? **…**  
And what are they banning in every town? **…**  
They stand on street corners, they rave and they shout  
They shout about things they know nothing about  
But what are they doing when the lights are turned out? **…**

title: Cockles And Mussels

## Formerly in the Irish Packet  
In Dublin's fair city, where the girls are so pretty  
I first set my eyes on sweet Molly Malone  
As she wheeled her wheel-barrow  
**Through streets broad and narrow**  
**Crying "cockles and mussels, alive, alive-o!"**  
**Alive, alive-o, alive, alive-o!**  
**Crying "cockles and mussels, alive, alive-o!"**  
She was a fishmonger, but sure 'twas no wonder  
For so were her father and mother before  
And they each wheeled their barrow  
**Through…**  
She died of a faver, and no one could save her  
And that was the end of sweet Molly Malone  
But her ghost wheels her barrow  
**Through…**

**I can hew, boys, I can hack it out**  
**I can hew the coal, I can dance and shout**  
**I can hew, boys, coal so black and fine**  
**I'm a collier lad, working down the mine**  
  
It's Saint Monday's day, and well I do admire  
To sit snug at home by my own coal fire  
Then it's down to the pub for a pint or two  
For to work on Monday, that would never do  
  
Now my son's fourteen, he's a strapping lad  
He'll go down to the mine just like his dad  
And when Friday comes we'll pick up our pay  
And we'll drink together to round out the day  
  
Well, I likes me whiskey and I likes me beer  
I'll drink fourteen pints and I'll not feel queer  
I can hold my liquor as well as any man  
And I'll dance and sing as long as I can  
  
And it's when I die then I know full well  
I'll not go to Heaven, I am bound for Hell  
And my pick and shovel, Old Nick he will admire  
And he'll set me to hewing coal for his own Hellfire

title: Courting In The Kitchen  
---  
  
## Formerly in the Irish Packet  
Come single belle and beau, to me now pay attention  
And love, I'll plainly show, is the devil's own invention  
For once I fell in love with a damsel so bewitchin'  
Miss Henrietta Bell, down in Captain Kelly's kitchen  
**To me toora loora la, to me toora loora laddy**  
**To me toora loora la, and me toora loora laddy**  
At the age of seventeen I was 'prenticed to a grocer  
Not far from Stephen's Green where Miss Bell she used to go, sir  
Her manners were so free, she set my heart a-twitchin'  
And she invited me to a hooley in the kitchen  
Next Sunday being the day we were to have the flare-up  
I dressed myself quite gay and I frizzed and oiled my hair up  
The Captain had no wife, and he had gone a-fishin'  
So we kicked up high life down belowstairs in the kitchen  
Just as the clock struck six we sat down to the table  
She handed tea and cakes and I ate while I was able  
I drank hot punch and tea 'til my side had got a stitch in  
And the hours passed quick 'way when you're courting in the kitchen  
With my arms around her waist, she slyly hinted marriage  
When to the door in haste came Captain Kelly's carriage  
Her eyes were full of hate and poison she was spittin'  
The captain kicked the door in and he stormed into the kitchen  
She flew up off my knees, full five feet up or higher  
And over heads and heels threw me slap in to the fire  
My new Repealers coat that I'd bought from Mr. Mitchum  
With a twenty-shilling note went to blazes in the kitchen  
I grieved to see my duds all smeared with soot and ashes  
When a tub of dirty suds right in my face she dashes  
As I lay on the floor and the water she kept pitchin'  
The footman broke the door and walked right in to the kitchen  
I said she did invite me, but she gave flat denial  
For assault she did indict me, and I was sent for trial  
She swore I robbed the house, in spite of all her screechin'  
And I got six months hard for my courting in the kitchen

title: The Crawl  
---  
  
## (from Sir Chauncey Bonnet, Esq.)  
**Well, we're good old boys, we come from the North Shore,  
 Drinkers and carousers the likes you've never seen;  
 And this night, by God! We drank till there was no more,  
 From the Troller to the Raven with all stops in between.**  
 It all began one afternoon on the shores of Ambleside,  
 We were sittin' there quite peacefully with the rising of the tide;  
 When an idea it came to mind for to usher in the Fall,  
 So we all agreed next Friday night we'd go out on the crawl.  
 We planned to have a gay old time, the cash we did not spare,  
 We left all the cars at home and paid the taxi fare;  
 I got out to Horseshoe Bay a little after five,  
 From a table in the corner I heard familiar voices rise.  
 Spirits they ran high that night, old stories we did share,  
 Of the days when we were younger men and never had a care;  
 The beer flowed like a river and we drank the keg near dry,  
 So we drained down all our glasses and were thirsty by-and-by.  
 Park Royal Hotel, The Rusty Gull, Square-Rigger and Queen's Cross,  
 We'd started out with eight good boys but half had gotten lost;  
 For you'll never keep the lads together when their eyes begin to rove,  
 So there was just the three of us that made it to Deep Cove.  
 We arrived out at The Raven just in time for the last call,  
 The final destination of this the first annual crawl;  
 We dug deep into our pockets there was no money to be found,  
 Nine miles home and for walking we are bound.

title: The Crayfish

"Fisherman, fisherman, standing by the sea,  
 Have you a crayfish that you can sell to me?"  
**By the wayside i-diddle-dee-di-doh.**  
 "Yes sir, yes sir, that indeed I do.  
 I've got a crayfish that I can sell to you."  
 Well, I took him on home and I thought he'd like a swim,  
 So I filled up the thunderjug and I threw the bugger in.  
 Late that night I thought I'd have a fit  
 When my old lady got up to _wash her face_.  
 "Husband, husband," she cried out to me,  
 "The devil's in the thunderjug and he's got hold of me!"  
 "Children, children, bring the looking glass.  
 Come and see the crayfish that bit your mother's _a-face_"  
 "Children, children, did you hear the grunt?  
 Come and see the crayfish that bit your mother's _nose_"  
That's the end of my song and there isn't anymore.  
 I've an apple in me pocket and you can have the core.  
( _alternate: )_  
That's the end of my song and I don't give a fuck.  
 There's a lemon up my asshole and you can have a suck.

Oh Danny Boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling  
From glen to glen, and down the mountainside.  
The summer's gone, and all the leaves are falling.  
'Tis you, 'tis you must go and I must bide.  
  
But come ye back when summer's in the meadow  
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,  
For I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow.  
Oh Danny Boy, oh Danny Boy, I love you so.  
  
But if you come, and all the flowers are dying  
And if I'm dead, as dead I well may be.  
Ye'll come and find the place where I am lying  
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.  
  
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,  
And o'er my grave shall warmer, sweeter be,  
And if you bend and tell me that you love me,  
Then I shall sleep in peace until you come to me.

title: Down Among The Dead Men

## (from Captain Whatsit the Dreadful)  
Here's a health to the Queen and a lasting peace:  
To faction an end; to wealth increase!  
Come let us drink it while we have breath  
For there's no drinking after death.  
**And he that will this health deny**  
**Down among the dead men, down among the dead men**  
**Down, down, down, down**  
**Down among the dead men let him lie!**  
In smiling Bacchus' joys I'll roll;  
Deny no pleasure to my soul  
Let Bacchus' health 'round quickly move  
For Bacchus is a friend to love.  
Let love and wine their rights maintain  
And their united pleasures reign  
While Bacchus' treasures crown the board,  
We'll drink the joys that both afford!  
Here's a health to the things that we hold dear:  
Life, Love, Liberty, and Cold Beer!  
To those who would these us deny:  
May ye sadly live and sober die!

My father was the keeper of the Eddystone light  
And he slept with a mermaid one fine night  
Out of this union there came three  
A porpoise and a porgy and the other was me!  
**Yo ho ho, the wind blows free,**  
**Oh for the life on the rolling sea** _!_  
One night, as I was a-trimming the glim  
Singing a verse from the evening hymn  
I heard a voice cry out "Ahoy!"  
And there was my mother, sitting on a buoy.  
"Oh, what has become of my children three?"  
My mother then inquired of me.  
"One's on exhibit as a talking fish  
The other was served in a chafing dish."  
Then the phosphorus flashed in her seaweed hair.  
I looked again, and my mother wasn't there  
But her voice came angrily out of the night  
"To Hell with the keeper of the Eddystone Light!"

title: Excursion Around The Bay

Well it was on this Monday morning and the day be calm and fine  
A harbour grace excursion with the boys who had the time  
And just before the sailor took the gangway from the pier  
I saw some fellow haul me wife aboard as a volunteer  
  
**Oh me, oh my, I heard me old wife cry,**  
**Oh me, oh my, I think I'm gonna die!**  
**Oh me, oh my, I heard me old wife say,**  
**"I wish I'd never taken this excursion around the bay"**  
  
We had three hundred souls on board, oh what a splendid sight,  
Matt Strong in regimentals, to make our spirits bright;  
With meself being in the double, with the funny things they'd say,  
And they'd choke themselves from laughing, when they see us in the bay.  
  
Now, me wife she got no better, she turned a sickly green,  
I gave her soap and candy, fat pork and gasoline;  
Castor-oil and sugar of candy, I rubbed hair-oil on her face,  
And they said she'd be a dandy, when she reaches Harbour Grace.  
  
My wife she got no better, my wife, my darling dear,  
The screeches from her throat, you could hear in Carbonear;  
I searched every place in Harbour Grace, searched every store and shop,  
To get her something for the cure, or take her to the hop.  
  
Oh, she died below the Brandies, as we were coming back,  
We buried her in the ocean, wrapped up in the Union Jack;  
And now I am a single man, in search of a pretty face,  
And the woman who says she'll have me, I'm off for Harbour Grace!

Give me the punch ladle; I'll fathom the bowl.  
**I'll fathom the bowl,**  
**I'll fathom the bowl**  
**Give me the punch ladle;**  
**I'll fathom the bowl**  
From France we do get brandy; from Jamaica comes rum;  
Sweet oranges and apples from Portugal come,  
But stout and strong cider are Ireland's control  
Give me the punch ladle; I'll fathom the bowl.  
Me wife she do disturb me when I'm lyin' at my ease  
She does as she likes; she says as she please.  
Me wife, she's the devil, she's black as the coal.  
Give me the punch ladle; I'll fathom the bowl.  
Me father he do lie in the depths of the sea  
No stone at his head, but what matters for he  
It's a clear crystal fountain near Ireland doth roll  
Give me the punch ladle; I'll fathom the bowl.  
Come all ye bold heroes, give an ear to me song!

## Formerly in the Irish Packet  
By a lonely prison wall, I heard a young girl calling  
"Michael, they have taken you away  
For you stole Trevelyan's corn, so the young might see the morn  
Now a prison ship lies waiting in the bay"  
**Low lie the fields of Athenry**  
**Where once we watched the small free birds fly**  
**Our love was on the wing, we had dreams and songs to sing**  
**It's so lonely 'round the fields of Athenry**  
By a lonely prison wall, I heard a young man calling  
"Nothing matters, Mary, when you're free  
Against the famine and the crown I rebelled, they ran me down  
Now you must raise our child with dignity"  
By a lonely harbor wall, she watched the last star falling  
As the prison ship sailed out against the sky  
And she'll wait and hope and pray, for her love in Botany Bay  
It's so lonely 'round the fields of Athenry

title: Finnegan's Wake  
category: irish packet  
---  
  
Tim Finnegan lived in Walker Street  
A gentle Irishman, mighty odd  
He'd a beautiful brogue so rich and sweet  
And to rise in the world he carried a hod  
Tim had a sort of a tipplin' way  
With the love of the liquor, poor Tim was born  
And to help him on with his work each day  
He'd a drop of the craythür every morn'  
  
**Whack fol the da, now, dance to your partner**  
**Round the floor your trotters shake**  
**Wasn't it the truth I tell you**  
**Lots of fun at Finnegan's wake**  
  
One morning Tim was rather full  
His head felt heavy, which made him shake  
He fell from the ladder and he broke his skull  
And they carried him home, his corpse to wake  
They rolled him up in a nice clean sheet  
And laid him out upon the bed  
With a gallon of whiskey at his feet  
And a barrel of porter at his head  
  
His friends assembled at the wake  
And Mrs. Finnegan called for lunch  
First they brought in tea and cake  
Then pipes, tobacco and whiskey punch  
Biddy O'Brien began to cry  
"Such a nice clean corpse did you ever see?  
Tim, mavourneen2, why did you die?"  
"Ah, hold your gob," said Paddy McGee  
  
Then Maggie O'Connor took up the job  
"O Biddy," says she, "you're wrong I'm sure"  
Biddy gave her a belt in the gob  
And left her sprawling on the floor  
Then the war did soon engage  
'Twas woman-to-woman and man-to-man  
Shillelagh law was all the rage  
And a row and a ruction soon began  
  
Then Mickey Maloney raised his head  
When a gallon of whiskey flew at him  
It missed, and falling on the bed  
The liquor scattered over Tim!  
Tim revives, look how he rises  
Timothy rising from the bed  
"Whirl your whiskey 'round like blazes,  
Thundering Christ, d'you think I'm dead?"

title: Fire Down Below  
---  
  
## From Tripple Nipple Jones  
I'm just a simple country lad to London just come down  
To tell you the scrapes and narrow escapes I had when last in town.  
'Twas market day and I'd sold me hay  
And stood things to admire.  
When all at once a chap called out  
He'd mastermind the fire.  
**Fire fire fire, fire down below.**  
**Let's hope that we may never see a fire down below.**  
I turned around to ask a lass the cause of all this stir,  
And if she'd mind as to be so kind as to tell me where it where.  
Said she "Young man, yes that I can,  
Do all that you inquire,  
So come with me, and you shall see,  
I'll take you where there's fire."  
With that she linked her arm in mine and down the street she steered  
To some back slum she called her home but still no fire appeared.  
In a house we creeped, upstairs we peeped  
Three stories high and higher.  
In a room we stopped, all night we popped  
But I couldn't find the fire.  
In the morning when I wakened up, my lady bird had flown.  
Not only lass, but all my brass, my watch my clothes were gone.  
Bare laggin' in feet, I ran in the street  
Me shirt me sole attire.  
The women all laughed, the men they chaffed  
But I kept callin' FIRE!  
But some good chance, I made it home, half-dead with shame and fright,  
And all that saw and knew me well said, "Spoonie, served you right."  
But the worst wasn't past, it came at last,  
I thought I should expire.  
Say what you will I was very ill  
And the doctor said 'twas fire.  
So come all of you good gentleman, and well courting have not been  
Be advised by me, don't foolish be, by all I've done and seen.  
Don't miss your ways on market days  
Or stand things to admire,  
But avoid back slums and female chums  
And don't go catching fire.

## From Tripple Nipple Jones  
As down the glen one Easter morn, to a city fair rode I  
There arm-ed lines of marching men, in squadrons passed me by  
No fife did hum, nor battle drum, did sound its dread tattoo,  
But the Angelus bell o'er the Liffey swell, rang out through the foggy dew  
Right proudly high over Dublin Town, they hung out the flag of war  
'Twas better to die 'neath an Irish sky, than at Sulva  
# 4  
 or Sud El Bar  
# 5  
And from the plains of Royal Meath, strong men came hurrying through  
While Britannia's Huns, with their long range guns, sailed in through the foggy dew  
Oh the night fell black, and the rifles' crack made perfidious Albion reel  
In the leaden rain, seven tongues of flame did shine o'er the lines of steel  
By each shining blade a prayer was said, that to Ireland her sons be true  
But when morning broke, still the war flag shook out its folds in the foggy dew  
'Twas Britannia bade our Wild Geese go, that small nations might be free  
But their lonely graves are by Sulva's waves, or the shore of the Great North Sea  
Oh, had they died by Pearse's side, or fought with Cathal Brugha  
# 6  
Their names we will keep, where the fenians sleep, 'neath the shroud of the foggy dew  
But the bravest fell, and the requiem bell, rang mournfully and clear  
For those who died, that Eastertide, in the springing of the year  
And the world did gaze, in deep amaze, at those fearless men but few  
Who bore the fight, that freedom's light, might shine through the foggy dew

Twas on the good ship Venus,  
By God you should have seen us-  
The figurehead was a whore in bed  
And the mast a throbbing penis.  
The Captain of that lugger  
Was known as a filthy bugger,  
Declared unfit to shovel shit  
From one pile to another.  
The Captain's daughter Charlotte  
By god she was a harlot  
At night her thighs were lily white  
By morning they were scarlet.  
The Captain's other daughter,  
Was swimming in the water,  
When peals of squeals revealed that eels  
Discovered her sexual quarter  
The bosun's name was Andy,  
By god he was a dandy  
We crushed his cock upon a rock  
For cumming in the brandy.  
The ship's dog's name was Rover  
We turned the poor thing over  
And ground and ground that faithful hound  
From Tenerife to Dover.  
The cook his name was Freeman,  
And he was a dirty demon,  
And he fed the crew on menstrual stew  
And hymens fried in semen  
The cabin boy's name was Ripper,  
A cunning little nipper,  
He lined his ass with broken glass  
And circumcised the skipper.  
And when we reached our station  
Through skillful navigation  
Our ship was sunk in a wave of spunk  
From too much masturbation.

## Formerly in the Irish Packet  
I'll tell you a story that happened to me  
One day as I went down to Yule-by-the-Sea  
The sun it was bright and the day it was warm  
Says I, "a quiet pint wouldn't do me no harm"  
I went in to the barman, I said "Give me a stout."  
Said the barman "I'm sorry, all the beer 'tis sold out  
Try whiskey, try sherry, ten years in the wood"  
Says I, "I'll try cider, I've heard that it's good"  
**Oh never, oh never, oh never again**  
**If I live to a hundred or a hundred and ten**  
**I fell to the ground and I couldn't get up**  
**After drinking a pint of that Johnny Jump Up**  
After leaving the pub I went back to the yard  
When I bumped into Brolfy, the big civic guard  
"Come here to me, boy, don't you know I'm the law"  
I upped with my fist and I shattered his jaw  
He fell to the ground with his knees doubled up  
But it wasn't I'd hit him, 'twas the Johnny Jump Up  
And the next man I met out in Yule-by-the-Sea  
Was an old man on crutches, and he said to me  
"I fear for me life I'll be hit by a car  
Won't you help me across to the railwaymans' bar?"  
After a drinking a sip of that cider so sweet  
He threw down his crutches and danced in the street  
I went down the Lee Road, a friend for to see  
The call it the madhouse in Cork-by-the-Lee  
And when I got up there, the truth I should tell  
They had the poor bugger locked up in his cell  
Said the guard testing him, "say these words if you can:  
'Around the ragged rock, the ragged rascal ran'"  
"Tell them I'm not crazy, tell them I'm not mad  
It was only a drop of the creature I had"  
A man died in the Union by the name of McNabb  
They washed him and laid him outside on a slab  
And after the coroner his measurements did take  
His wife took him home for a bloody fine wake  
'Twas about twelve o'clock and the beer it was high  
The corpse he sat up, and he says with a sigh  
"I can't get to Heaven, they won't let me up  
'Til I bring them a pint of that Johnny Jump Up"

Come all ye sailors bold, and when me tale is told  
I know ye all will sadly pity me  
For I was a god-damn fool in the port o' Liverpool  
On the voyage when I first paid off from sea  
**Oh Maggie Maggie May, they have taken you away**  
**For to slave upon Van Dieman's cruel shore**  
**Oh, you robbed many a sailor, and many a drunken whaler**  
**But you'll never cruise down Paradise Street no more!**  
I paid off at the Home, after a voyage from Sierra Leone  
Two pound ten a month had been my pay;  
As I jingled in me tin, I was sadly taken in  
By a lady of the name of Maggie May  
When I steered into her, I hadn't got a care  
I was cruisin' up and down old Canning Place;  
She was in a gown so fine, like a frigate of the line,  
And bein' a sailorman, I gave her chase  
**Chorus**  
She gave me a saucy nod, and like a farmer's clod  
I let her take me line abreast in tow  
An' under all plain sail, we ran before the gale  
An' to the Crow's Nest Tavern we did go  
Next mornin' when I woke, I found that I was broke  
I hadn't got a penny to me name  
So I had to pop me suit, me John Ls and me Boots  
Down in the Kelly Pawn Shop Number Nine  
**Oh you theivin' Maggie May, ye robbed me of my pay**  
**When I slept with you that night ashore**  
**Oh, guilty the jury found her, for robbin' a homeward-bounder**  
**And she'll never roll down Paradise Street no more**  
She was chained and sent away from Liverpool one day;  
The lads they cheered as she sailed down the Bay  
And every sailor lad, he only was too glad  
They'd sent the old whore out to Botany Bay!

title: The Mariner's Revenge Song

We are two mariners  
Our ship's sole survivors  
In this belly of a whale.  
Its ribs are ceiling beams  
Its guts are carpeting  
I guess we have some time to kill.  
  
You may not remember me  
I was a child of three  
And you, a lad of eighteen.  
But I remember you  
And I will relate to you  
How our histories interweave:  
At the time you were  
 a rake and a roustabout  
Spending all your money  
 on the whores and hounds (oh, oh)  
You had a charming air  
All cheap and debonair  
My widowed mother found so sweet,  
And so she took you in  
Her sheets still warm with him  
Now filled with filth and foul disease.  
  
As time wore on you proved  
 a debt-ridden drunken mess  
Leaving my mother  
 a poor consumptive wretch  
 (oh, oh)  
And then you disappeared  
Your gambling arrears  
The only thing you left behind.  
And then the magistrate  
Reclaimed our small estateAnd my poor mother lost her mind.  
  
Then, one day in spring  
 my dear sweet mother died  
But, before she did  
 I took her hand as she, dying, cried:  
 (oh, oh)  
**"Find him, Bind him  
**** Tie him to a pole and break  
 ****His fingers to splinters  
**** Drag him to a hole until he ****Wakes up naked  
**** Clawing at the ceiling ****Of his grave!"** | It took me fifteen yearsTo swallow all my tears  
Among the urchins in the street  
Until a priory  
Took pity and hired me  
To keep their vestry nice and neat.  
  
But, never once in the employ  
 of these holy men  
Did I ever, once turn my mind from the thought of revenge (oh, oh)  
One night I overheard  
The prior exchanging words  
With a penitent whaler from the sea:  
The captain of his ship  
Who matched you toe to tipWas known for wanton cruelty.  
  
The following day  
 I shipped to sea  
 with a privateer  
And in the whistle  
 of the wind  
 I could almost hear (oh, oh)  
**Chorus**  
"There is one thing I must say to you  
As you sail across the sea  
Always, your mother will watch over you  
As you avenge this wicked deed"  
  
And then, that fateful night  
We had you in our sight  
After twenty months at sea  
Your starboard flank abeam  
I was getting my muskets clean  
When came this rumbling from beneath  
  
The ocean shook  
, the sky went black  
 and the captain quailed  
And before us grew  
 the angry jaws  
 of a giant whale   
  
(oh..)  
  
I don't know how I survived  
The crew all was chewed alive  
I must have slipped between his teeth  
But, oh, what providence  
What divine intelligence  
That you should survive  
As well as me  
  
It gives my heart great joy  
 to see your eyes fill with fearSo lean in close  
 and I will whisper  
he last words you'll hear  
 (oh, oh) |

One faithful harp shall praise thee!"  
The Minstrel fell, but the foeman's steel  
Could not bring that proud soul under  
The harp he loved ne'er spoke again

They shall never sound in slavery!"

**They said it was a sin and shame and they winked at one another**  
**And every drink in the place was full the night Pat Murphy died**  
As Mrs. Murphy sat in the corner pouring out her grief  
Kelly and his gang came tearing down the street  
They went into an empty room and a bottle of whiskey stole  
They put the bottle with the corpse to keep that whiskey cold  
About two o'clock in the morning after emptying the jug  
Doyle rolls up the icebox lid to see poor Paddy's mug  
We stopped the clock so Mrs. Murphy couldn't tell the time  
And at a quarter after two we argued it was nine  
They stopped the hearse on George Street outside some damn saloon  
They all went in at half past eight and staggered out at noon  
They went up to the graveyard, so holy and sublime  
Found out when they got there, they'd left the corpse behind  
Oh, the night that Paddy Murphy died is a night I'll never forget  
Some of the boys got loaded drunk and they ain't been sober yet  
As long as a bottle was passed around every man was feeling gay  
O'Leary came with the bagpipes, some music for to play

## From The Watersons' 2002 album _A Dark Light_  
Come, come with me out to the old churchyard,  
I so well know those paths 'neath the soft green sward.  
Friends slumber in there that we want to regard;  
We will trace out their names in the old churchyard.  
Mourn not for them, their trials are o'er,  
And why weep for those who will weep no more?  
For sweet is their sleep, though cold and hard  
Their pillows may be in the old churchyard.  
I know that it's vain when our friends depart  
To breathe kind words to a broken heart;  
And I know that the joy of life is marred  
When we follow lost friends to the old churchyard.  
But were I at rest 'neath yonder tree,  
Oh, why would you weep, my friends, for me?  
I'm so weary, so wayworn, why would you retard  
The peace I seek in the old churchyard?  
Why weep for me, for I'm anxious to go  
To that haven of rest where no tears ever flow;  
And I fear not to enter that dark lonely tomb  
Where our saviour has lain and conquered the gloom.  
I rest in the hope that one bright day  
Sunshine will burst to these prisons of clay,  
And old Gabriel's trumpet and voice of the Lord  
Will wake up the dead in the old churchyard.

title: Old Dun Cow

Some friends and I in a public house were playin' dominoes one night  
When into the room a fireman came, his face all chalky white  
"What's up," says Brown, "Have you seen a ghost? Have you seen your Aunt Mariah?"  
"Oh me Aunt Mariah be buggered," said he, "The bleedin' pub's on fire!"  
"Oh" says Brown, "what a bit o' luck, everybody follow me  
It's down to the cellar, if the fire's no there, we'll have a grand old spree!"  
So we all went down with good old Brown, and the booze we could not miss,  
And we hadn't been there ten minutes or more 'til we were quite like this: oh  
**There was Brown, upside down, moppin' up the whiskey on the floor,**  
" **Booze! Booze!" the firemen cried, as they cam a-knockin' at the door;**  
**Oh don't let 'em in 'til it's all mopped up, somebody shouted "MacIntyre!" MacIntyre!!!**  
**And we all got blue blind paralytic drunk when the Old Dun Cow caught fire**.  
Then Smith went over to the port wine tub and gave it just two hard knocks,  
Started takin' off his pantaloons, likewise his shoes and socks;  
"Hold on," says Brown, "That ain't allowed, you can't do that there here!  
Don't be washing your trousers in the port wine tub when we've got [Genesee] beer!"  
Oh, then there came a mighty crash, half the bloody roof caved in,  
We were drownin' in the fireman's hose, though we were almost happy,  
So we got some tacks and some old wet sacks, and we tacked ourselves inside,  
And we sat there getting bleary-eyed drunk when the Old Dun Cow caught fire.

P Stands For Paddy  
As went out one fine morning  
For to take a little walk  
I sat myself down by an old stone wall  
To hear two lovers talk.  
 To hear two lovers talk, me love  
To hear what they might say  
That I might learn a little of love before I go away.  
**And 'P' stands for Paddy, I suppose**  
' **J' for my love John**  
**And 'W' stands for false Willy-o**  
**But Johnny is the fairest man.**  
**Oh, Johnny is the fairest man, she cried**  
**Johnny is the fairest man**  
**Oh I don't care what anybody says, for Johnny is the fairest man.**  
Oh I won't sit beside you, love,  
Not now or any other time  
For you, you love another pretty maid  
And your heart's no longer mine.  
Your heart's no longer mine, she cried  
You heart's no longer mine  
For you, you love another pretty maid and your heart's no longer mine.  
Well I will climb a high high tree  
And rob a little bird's nest  
And I will take whatever I can find  
To the arms I love the best.  
To the arms I love the best, she cried  
The arms I love the best  
Oh, I will take whatever I can find to the arms I love the best.

## Formerly in the Irish Packet  
Well it's by the hush, me boys, and that's to mind your noise  
And listen to poor Paddy's sad narration  
For I was by hunger pressed, and in poverty distressed  
So I took a thought to leave the Irish nation  
**Hear me, boys, now take my advice**  
**To America I'll have ye not be going**  
**There is nothing here but war, where the murderin' cannons roar**  
**And I wish I was at home in dear old Dublin**  
Well I sold me horse and cow, my little pigs and sow  
My father's plot of land I soon departed  
And me sweetheart Bidd McGee, I'm afraid I'll never see  
For I left her there that morning broken-hearted  
Well meself and a hundred more, to America sailed o'er  
Our fortunes to be makin' we were thinkin'  
But when we got to Yankee land, they shoved a gun into our hands  
Saying, "Paddy, you must go and fight for Lincoln"  
General Meagher to us he said, if you get shot or lose your head  
Every mother's son of you will get a pension  
Well in the war I lost me leg; all I have's this wooden peg,  
And by God this is the truth to you I mention  
Well I think meself in luck, if I get fed on Indian buck  
And old Ireland is the country I delight in  
With the devil, I do say, it's curse Americay  
For I think I've had enough of your hard fightin'

## (From Meister Jaeger)  
In 1841 I put me corduroy britches on  
I put me corduroy britches on  
To work upon the railway  
**Tira me ori ori ay, tira me ori ori ay**  
**Tira me ori ori ay, to work upon the railway**  
In 1842 I left the old land for the new  
Bad cess to the luck that brought me through  
To work upon the railway  
In 1843 we hit Chicago on a spree  
The devil got a hold of me  
While working on the railway  
In 1844 while standing on the great lake shore  
We laid the track then saw no more  
While working on the railway  
In 1845 when Daniel O'Connell was alive  
In Kansas City we did arrive  
To work upon the railway  
In 1846 had a pain in me ass from carrying bricks  
With hammers and nails and shovels and picks  
A working upon the railway  
It's Paddy do this and Paddy do that  
Without a stocking or cravat _(or: me boss is loud, and he is fat)_  
And nothing but an old straw hat _(I've had enough shite to fill up me hat)_  
While working on the railway  
In 1848 me hands did blister and me belly did ache  
We heard of gold and made a stake  
While working on the railway  
In 1849 the California hills looked fine  
We found some gold and left behind  
The workings of the railway

So fill me to the parting glass, good night and joy be with you all  
Oh, all the comrades that e'er I've had, they are sorry for my going away  
And all the sweethearts that e'er I've had, would wish me one more day to stay  
But since it falls unto my lot that I should rise and you should not  
I'll gently rise and I'll softly call good night and joy be with you all  
Good night, and joy be with you all

## From The Whip!  
Far away and o'er the moor,  
Morar waits for a boat that saileth,  
Far away down Lowland way,  
I dream the dream I learned, lad,  
**By the light o' the peat-fire flame,**  
**Light for love, for lilt o' laughter,**  
**By the light o' the peat-fire flame,**  
**The light the hill-folk yearn for.**  
Far away, down Lowland way,  
Grim's the toil, without tune or dream, lad,  
All you need's a creel and love,  
For the dream the heart can weave, lad  
Far away the tramp and tread,  
Tune and laughter of all the heroes,  
Pulls me onward o'er the trail  
Of the dream my heart may weave, lad,

Some miles upon the ocean  
Come, now me jolly boys,  
I bid you all adieu  
No more to the wars will I go with you  
But I'll ramble the country through and through  
And I'll be a rambling solider  
The King he has commanded me  
To range this country over  
From Woolwich up to Liverpool  
And from Plymouth back to Dover  
A'courtin' all the girls,  
Both old and young,  
With me ramrod in me hand and me flattery tongue  
To court them all but marry none  
And I'll be a rambling soldier  
And when these wars are at an end  
I'm not afraid to mention  
The King will hand me my discharge,  
A guinea and a pension  
No doubt some lassies will me blame  
But none of them will know my name  
And if you want to know the same  
My name is Rambling Soldier  
… And they call me a rambling soldier

## Formerly in the Irish Packet  
While going to the fair of Dingle  
One fine morning last July  
When going down the road before me  
A red-haired girl I chanced to spy  
I went to her, said, "aye, young lady,  
My donkey he will carry two  
And seeing how you have no donkey  
To the Dingle fair I'll ride with you"  
**Keep your hands off red-haired Mary**  
**Her and I will soon be wed**  
**We'll see the priest this very morning**  
**Tonight we'll lie in a marriage bed**  
Now when we reached the town of Dingle  
I took her hand to say goodbye  
When a tinker man stepped up beside me  
And he belted me in my left eye  
Now I was feeling kinda peevish  
And me poor old eye was sad and sore  
And I gently tapped him with my hobnails  
And he flew back through Murphy's door  
A policeman came around the corner  
And he told me I had broke the law  
When the donkey kicked him in the kneecap  
And he fell down and broke his jaw  
Then he went off to find his brother  
The biggest man you ever did see  
He gently tapped me with his knuckles  
And I was minus two front teeth  
Now the red-haired girl she kept on smiling  
"I'll go with you, young man," she said  
"We'll forget the priest this very morning  
And tonight we'll lie in Murphy's shed"  
**Keep your hands off red-haired Mary**  
**Her and I will soon be wed**  
**We'll forget the priest this very morning**  
**Tonight we'll lie in Murphy's shed**  
Now through the fair we rode together  
My black eye and her red hair  
Smiling gaily at the tinkers  
And my God we were a handsome pair!

## Formerly in the Irish Packet  
In the merry month of June from my home I started  
Left the girls of Tuam nearly broken-hearted  
Saluted me Father dear, kissed me darlin' Mother  
Drank a pint of beer, my grief and tears to smother  
Then off to reap the corn, leave where I was born  
I cut a stout blackthorn to banish ghosts and goblins  
Bought a pair of brogues, rattlin' o'er the bogs  
And frightened all the dogs on the rocky road to Dublin  
**One, two, three, four, five!**  
**Hunt the hare and turn her down the rocky road**  
**All the way to Dublin, whack fol-lol-de-ra**  
In Mullingar that night I rested limbs so weary  
Started by daylight next morning bright and airy  
Took a drop of the pure to keep my heart from sinking  
That's the Paddy's cure, whene'er he's on for drinking  
To see the lassies smile, laughing all the while  
At my curious style, 'twould set your heart a-bubbling  
Asked if I was hired, wages I required  
'Till I was almost tired of the rocky road to Dublin  
In Dublin next arrived, I thought it such a pity  
To be so soon deprived a view of that fine city  
So then I took a stroll out among the quality  
My bundle it was stolen in a neat locality  
Something crossed my mind, when I looked behind  
No bundle could I find upon me stick a-wobblin'  
Enquiring for the rogue, found me Connaught brogue  
Wasn't much in vogue on the rocky road to Dublin  
From there I got away, me spirits never failing  
Landed on the quay just as the ship was sailing  
The captain at me roared, said that no room had he  
When I jumped aboard, a cabin found for Paddy  
Down among the pigs, played some funny rigs  
Danced some hearty jigs, the water 'round me bubbling  
When off Holyhead, wished meself was dead  
Or better far, instead, on the rocky road to Dublin  
The boys of Liverpool, when we safely landed  
Called meself a fool, I could no longer stand it  
Blood began to boil, temper I was losing  
Poor old Erin's isle they began abusing  
"Hurrah me soul!" says I, shillelagh I let fly  
Some Galway boys were nigh, they saw I was a-hobblin'  
With a loud "Hurray!" they joined in the affray  
We quickly cleared the way, for the rocky road to Dublin

If all the young lassies were locks on a gate  
Then I'd be the key to insert and rotate  
If all the young lassies were boats on the ocean  
Then I'd be the waves and I'd show 'em the motion  
If all the young lassies were telephone poles  
Then I'd be the squirrel to crack nuts in their holes  
If all the young lassies were sheep in the clover  
Then I'd and I'd ram and I'd ram 'em all over  
If all the young lassies were winds of the sea  
Then I'd be a sail and I'd let them blow me  
If all the young laddies were pipes in the yard  
Then after I drained 'em they'd still remain hard  
If laddies were watches in shiny gold cases  
Then I'd be the hands and I'd sit on their faces  
If all the young laddies were camels to pack  
I'd hump them all day, and I'd never spit back  
If all the young laddies were coconuts sweet  
Then I'd suck out their juices and chew on their meat  
If all the young laddies were needles and pins  
Then I'd be cushion to hold their pricks in  
If all the young laddies were puppies full grown  
Then I'd be the ground where they'd bury their bone  
If all the young laddies were singing this song  
It'd be over too quick and it'd be half as long

Seen the Hudson and seen the Clyde,  
I've courted by Loch Lomond's side  
But I dearly love the border  
Often I have mind o' the day  
With my lass, I strolled by the Tay,  
But all it's beauty fades away  
Among the hills o' the border  
There's a certain peace of mind  
Bonnie lasses there you'll find  
Men so sturdy, men so kind  
Among the hills of the border

 She's queen of all the whores that work down at the old casino.  
 She used to screw for monkey nuts, but now she fucks for vino.  
 Oh, Serafina's got no drawers, I've been ashore and seen her.  
 She's got no time to put 'em on, that hard-fucked Serafina.  
 She guzzles pisco, beer and gin; on rum her mum did wean her.  
 She smokes just like the chimney stack on a PSNC steamer.  
 She'll claw and bite and kick and scratch when in the old arena.  
 She'll rob you blind if she gets the chance, that dirty she-hyena.  
 Oh, I was young and in my prime, I first met Serafina.  
 But the next morning when I woke up I wished I'd never seen her.  
 For I was robbed, my gear was gone, and so was Serafina.  
 She'd run off with a Dago man who played the concertina.  
 Well, I fucked the whores in Callao and then the ones in Lima.  
 But the randiest whore I ever fucked was the lovely Serafina.

## (from Whiskey Richards)  
Well a Scotsman clad in kilt left the bar one evening fair  
 One could tell by how he walked that he'd drunk more than his share  
 He fumbled round until he could no longer keep his feet  
**Then he stumbled off into the grass to sleep beside the street**  
**Ring-ding-did-a-little-la-di-oh, Ring-di-diddly-eye-oh,  
 He stumbled off into the grass to sleep beside the street**  
 About that time two young n' lovely girls just happened by  
 One says to the other with a twinkle in her eye  
 "See yon sleeping Scotsman so strong and handsome built,  
**I wonder if it's true what they don't wear beneath the kilt."**  
 They crept up on that sleeping Scotsman quiet as could be  
 Lifted up his kilt about an inch so they could see  
 And there behold for them to view beneath his Scottish skirt  
**Was nothing more than God had graced him with upon his birth**  
 They marveled for a moment then one said, "We must be gone.  
 Let's leave a present for our friend before we move along."  
 As a gift they left a blue silk ribbon tied into a bow  
**Around the bonnie star the Scot's kilt did lift and show.**  
 Now the Scotsman woke to nature's call and stumbled towards the trees  
 Behind a bush he lifts his kilt and gawks at what he sees  
 And in a startled voice he says to what's before his eyes  
**"Lad I don't know you've been but I see you won first prize."**

Shiver my timbers, shiver my sides

The devil himself would have to call them scum  
Every man aboard would have killed his mate  
For a bag of guineas or a piece of eight  
A piece of eight! A piece of eight! _five, six, seven, eight!_  
Hulla wacka ulla wacka something not right  
Many wicked icky things gonna happen tonight  
Hulla wacka ulla wacka sailor man beware

_One more time now!_

There are secrets that sleep with old Davy Jones  
**Yo ho heave ho**  
When the mainsail's set and the anchor's weighed  
There's no turning back from any course that's laid  
And when greed and villainy sail the sea  
You can bet your boots there'll be _treachery…__treachery… treachery... [1 beat] oooh!_

Blistered burns the soul  
The floggings they're a plenty, but reasons there are none  
Our backs belong to landlords where branded is their name  
Paid for with ten shillings  
Cheap labor never breaks  
The silver moon is shinin'  
Cools the copper blood  
Where the livin' meet the dead and together dance as one  
Agony, will you cleanse this misery?  
For it's never again I'll breathe the air of home  
From this sandy edge the rolling sea breaks my revenge  
With each whisper a thousand waves I hear roar  
I'm coming home  
Dark is the horizon blackened by the sun  
This rotten cage of Bridgetown is where I now belong

Oh me name's Able Rodgers, a share man am I  
 On a three masted schooner from Twillingate Isle  
 I've been the world over north, south, east, and west  
 But the middle of nowhere wheres' I likes it best  
**Where its wave over wave, sea over bow  
 I'm as happy a man as the sea will allow  
 Theres no other life for a sailor like me  
 And to sail the salt sea boys, sail the sea  
 There's no other life but to sail the salt sea**  
 Well I leave my wife lonely ten months of the year  
 For she built me a home and raised my children there  
 She never come out to bid farewell to me  
 Or ken why a sailor must sail the salt sea  
 The work it is hard and the hours are long  
 But my spirit is willing, my back it is strong  
 And when the works over the whiskey will pour  
 We'll dance with the girls upon some foreign shore  
 I've sailed the world over for decades or more  
 And oft times I wonder what I do it for  
 I dont know the answer its pleasure and pain  
 But with life to live over I'd do it again

title: Whiskey In The Jar

As I was going over the far-famed Kerry Mountains  
I met with Captain Farrell and his money he was counting  
I first produced my pistol, and then produced my rapier  
Saying "stand and deliver for I am a bold deceiver"  
**Musha ring dum a do dum a da**  
**Whack fol the daddy-o, whack fol the daddy-o**  
**There's whiskey in the jar**  
I counted out his money and it made a pretty penny  
I put it in my pocket and I took it home to Jenny  
She sighed and she swore that she never would deceive me  
But the devil take the women for they never can be easy  
I went into my chamber all for to take a slumber  
I dreamt of gold and jewels, and sure it was no wonder  
That Jenny took my changes and she filled them up with water  
And sent for Captain Farrell to make ready for the slaughter  
T'was early in the morning, afore I rose to travel  
Up comes a band of footmen, and likewise Captain Farrell  
I first produced my pistol for she'd stolen away my rapier  
But I couldn't shoot the water so a prisoner I was taken  
Well they threw me in the jail, said the years I would be counting  
For robbing Captain Farrell in the far-famed Kerry Mountains  
But they didn't take me fists so I knocked the jailer down  
And I bid a fond farewell to that jail in Liverpool town  
If anyone can aid me it's my brother in the army  
If I can find his station in Cork or in Killarney  
And if he'll go with me we'll go roving in Kilkenny  
I'm sure he'll treat me better than my own disporting Jenny  
There's some take delight in the hurling and the bowling  
And some take delight in the carriages a-rolling  
But I take delight in the juice of the barley  
And courting pretty, fair maids in the morning bright and early

Now brave boys we're on for marching  
Off to Portugal or Spain  
The drums are beating, banners flying  
The devil at home will come tonight  
Love, fair thee well  
**With me tiddlee aye dul do dul dum a dah**  
**Me tiddlee aye dul do dul dum a dah**  
**Me rightful toora laddie**  
**Oh, there's whiskey in the jar**  
**Oh, whiskey, you're the devil, you're leading me astray**  
**Over hills and mountains, and to a merry quay**  
**You're sweet, you're strong, you're decent**  
**Oh, you're spunkier than tay**  
**Oh, whiskey, you're me darling drunk or sober**  
Said the mother, "do not wrong me,  
Don't take me daughter from me  
For if you do I will torment you  
And after that me ghost will haunt you"  
Love, fair thee well  
Oh, the French are fighting boldly  
Men are dying hot and cowardly  
Give every man his flash and powder  
His firelock on his shoulder  
Love, fare thee well

| **Here's to the whores of Sailortown,  
 The white, the black, the yellow and brown.  
 Walk right in, lay your money down  
 And fuck the night away.**  
There's Betty from Port Adelaide,  
 The prettiest hooker I ever laid.  
 She has a cunt that is snug enough,  
 And tits as big as the Sunday duff.  
 There's a sing-song gal out in Hong Kong  
 Takes every inch of my whopping dong.  
 She knows her way around my cock  
 From the hours we spent at strop and block.  
 In Dunkirk there is sweet Marie,  
 As clever a tart as you will see.  
 Set a franc down by your cup -  
 With her cunt lips she'll pick it up.  
 There's Fat Louise who weighs a ton,  
 Built like a cow, in more ways than one:  
 Shoves a champagne bottle up her cunt  
 'Til nothing is seen expect the punt.  
There's Nelly out in Frisco town,  
 She can really blow me down.  
 Says I'm better than the rest,  
 Let's me fuck the hole I like the best. | In Antwerp, by the Kattendyke,  
 Annie sings a song I like:  
 "Jiggy-jiggy, Johnny, it's so fine -  
 Come and get some sixty-nine."  
 There's Maria down in Valapo,  
 Sweet as far as putas go.  
 Whatever I want she doesn't mind -  
 Up on top or from behind.  
There's Nancy lives in Port Mahon,  
 By God, she is an Amazon.  
 She'll wrap her legs around my waist  
 And mash her tits against my face.  
Now Meg's the queen of Tiger Bay,  
 Always right for a roll in the hay.  
 If a sailor comes in worth a mint  
 She will fuck him 'til he's skint.  
 You'll find Kate in Liverpool -  
 She could run whoring school.  
 She'll drink, and fuck me all week long  
 'Til my pulp and jiz are both all gone. |

## Formerly in the Irish Packet  
  
Oh, the summertime is coming  
And the trees, they are a-blooming  
And the wild mountain thyme  
Grows among the blooming heather  
  
**Will ye go, lassie, go**  
**And we'll all go together**  
**To pick wild mountain thyme**  
**All around the blooming heather**  
**Will ye go, lassie, go**  
  
I will build my love a bower  
By yon pure and crystal fountain  
And around it I will pile  
All the flowers of the mountain  
  
If me love should ever leave me  
I will surely find another  
Where the wild mountain thyme  
Grows around the blooming heather
