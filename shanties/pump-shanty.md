title: Pump Shanty

**Pump me boys, pump her dry**  
**Down to hell and up to the sky**  
**Bend your back and break your bones**  
**We're just a thousand miles from home**  

They say life has its ups and downs  
That really now is quite profound  
I'd like to push the capstan round  
But it's pump me boys before we drown  

The captain's daughter I suppose  
Could be called an English Rose  
What would you think when I propose  
The pox she gave to me a dose.  

This rose well she did prick me sore  
I never felt so bad before  
Thanks to the girl I do adore  
I thought I'd never pump no more.  

I called the doctor right away  
To find out what he had to say  
That's two pounds ten, get on your way  
I'm sure this girl is in his pay.  

Sometimes while lying in me bed  
And thinking of me day ahead  
I wish that I could wake up dead  
But pumpin's all I get instead  

The ocean we all do adore  
So come on lads let's pump some more  
Don't worry if you're stiff and sore  
I'm sure we've pumped this bit before..  

There's so much water down below  
Just how it got there I don't know  
The old man says let's roll and go  
But I think we're bound for Davey Jones.
