Now we are ready to head for the horn,  
**Way, hey, roll an' go!**  
Our boots and our clothes boys are all in the pawn,  
**To me rollickin' randy dandy-o!**  

**Heave a pawl, oh, heave away,**  
**Way, hey, roll an' go!**  
**The anchor's on board an' the cable's all stored,**  
**To me rollickin' randy dandy-o!**  

Sing goodbye to Sally an' goodbye to Sue  
For we are the boy-os who can kick 'er through  

Come breast the bars, bullies, an' heave her away  
Soon we'll be rollin' her 'way down the Bay  

Roust 'er up, bullies, the wind's drawin' free  
So get on yer glad rags an' drive 'er to sea  

We're outward bound for Valipo Bay,  
Get crackin', me lads, 'tis a hell of a way!
