Lord Nelson knew the perfect way to cure your 'mal-de-mer',  
So if you pay attention, his secret I will share,  
To any sea-sick sailor he'd give this advice for free:  
"If you're feeling sea-sick, sit underneath a tree!"  
  
**I'm marching inland from the shore, over m' shoulder I'm carrying an oar,**  
**When someone asks me: "What - is that funny thing you've got?"**  
**Then I know I'll never go to sea no more, no more,**  
**Then I know I'll never go to sea no more!**  
  
Columbus he set-sail to find out if the world was round,  
He kept on sailing to the West until he ran aground,  
He thought he'd found The Indies but he'd found the U.S.A.,  
I know some navigators who can still do that today.  
  
Drake he's in his hammock and a thousand miles away,  
Grenville's REVENGE is at the bottom of the bay,  
Many's the famous sailor never came home from the sea,  
Just take my advice, Jack, come and follow me.  
  
Sailors take a warning from these men of high renown,  
When you leave the ocean and it's time to settle down,  
Never cast your anchor less than ninety miles from shore,  
There'd always be temptation to be off to sea once more.
