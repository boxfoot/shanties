title: The Golden Vanity  
---  
  
There was a lofty ship and they put her out to sea  
And the name of the ship was the Golden Vanity  
And they sailed her on **the lowland lowland low**  
**And they sailed her on the lowland sea**  
  
And she had not been sailing but two weeks or three  
When she was overtaken by a Turkish revelry  
As she sailed along the lowland lowland low...  
  
Then boldly up spoke our little cabin boy  
Saying, What would you give me if the galley I destroy  
If I sink them in the lowland lowland low  
  
To the man that them destroys, our captain then replied  
Five thousand pounds and my daughter for his bride  
If he'll sink them in the lowland lowland low  
  
The boy he made ready and overboard went he  
And he swam to the side of the Turkish enemy  
As she lay along the lowlands lowlands low  
  
And he had a brace and auger made for the use  
And he bored nine holes in her hull all at once  
As she lay along the lowland lowland low  
  
And some were playing poker and some were playing dice  
And some were in their hammocks and the sea as cold as ice  
And the water rushed in and it dazzled to their eyes  
  
He swam back to his ship and he beat upon the side  
Crying, Shipmates take me up for I'm wearied with the tide  
And I'm weary of the lowlands lowlands low  
  
Well, I'll not pick you up, the captain then replied  
I'll shoot you, I'll drown you, I'll sink you in the tide  
I will sink you in the lowland lowland low  
  
If it was not for the love that I bear for your men  
I'd do unto you as I did unto them  
I would sink you in the lowland lowland low  
  
And the boy bowed his head and down sank he  
And he said farewell to the Golden Vanity  
As she lay along the lowland lowland low
