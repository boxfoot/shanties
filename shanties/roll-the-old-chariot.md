Oh a drop of Nelson’s Blood wouldn’t do me any harm  
Oh a drop of Nelson’s Blood wouldn’t do me any harm  
Oh a drop of Nelson’s Blood wouldn’t do me any harm  
**And we’ll all hang on behind**

**And we’ll roll the old chariot along**  
**We’ll roll the old chariot along**  
**We’ll roll the old chariot along**  
**And we’ll all hang on behind**

And a little mug of beer wouldn’t do me any harm...

And a plate of Irish stew...

And a little slug of gin...

And a little drop of wine...

And a night upon the shore...

And a drop of Nelson’s blood...
