In South Australia I was born  
**Heave away, haul away**  
South Australia, 'round Cape Horn  
**We're bound for South Australia**  

**Haul away you rolling kings**  
**Heave away, haul away**  
**Haul away you'll hear me say**  
**We're bound for South Australia**  

If there's just one thing that grieves my mind  
To leave Miss Nancy Blair's behind  

Oh when we wallop 'round Cape Horn  
You'll wish to God you'd never been born  

I wish I was in Australia's strand  
A glass of whiskey in my hand  

Port Adelaide's a grand old town  
There's plenty of girls to go around  

South Australia's my native land  
Full of flies and fleas and sand  

When I first shipped out to sea  
My girl said she'd be true to me  

South Australia's got great waves  
Great white sharks and surfer babes  

Hamlet's uncle's got him down  
Married his mom and stole his crown
